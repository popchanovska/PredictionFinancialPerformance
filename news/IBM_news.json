    "content": "Opinion Last week, I committed a crime. No, I did not defraud the IRS/HMRC or steal some Snyder's Pretzels/Cheesy Wotsits. It was much worse. A keen reader pointed out that I had miscounted the number of versions of Db2, IBM's relational database.\nAlthough I had listed the versions of IBM's 40-year-old database running on Linux or Unix or Windows (LUW) and its System Z mainframe, I neglected to mention the version running on the mid-range server once known as AS/400, now – after several intermediary name changes – called iSeries or IBM i.\nShamed though I was by my error, I could at least find comfort in the knowledge that I had not – like IBM to all outward appearances – forgotten about Db2 altogether.\nFor more than four years, I have been asking, enticing, cajoling, coaxing, prompting, tempting, persuading, encouraging, inciting, and seducing IBM to talk to The Register about Db2. I've tried the front door, the back door, the side door, the trap door, the doors of perception, the garden gate, and the sunroof. It's all been useless.\nNot that the trials and tribulations of being a journalist should concern anyone working in tech, but since Big Blue is so desperate not to talk about Db2, I thought it would be fun to give the notoriously reliable database another airing.\nDb2 was modeled on the ideas of IBM researcher Edgar Frank \"Ted\" Codd, who first described the theory of relational databases in 1970. The first products became available on IBM mainframes in 1983 and later on Unix, Linux, and Windows. The product has been styled as DB/2, then DB2, before settling on the current Db2 in 2017. According to database pioneer Michael Stonebraker, it was Db2's adoption of SQL on its world-dominating mainframe platform that led to the query language becoming the de facto standard.\nSince the 1980s, Db2 has become a database of choice for applications that need to be both big and dependable. Even today, among Db2's user base, banks make up nearly 43 percent, according to some measures. Among them are American Express, Bank of America, Citibank, and Deutsche Bank.\nExperts say Db2 is well engineered, reliable, and not as dated as one might imagine. Its only commercial rival, Oracle, has hardly updated its underlying architecture, but that doesn't stop Larry Ellison's visage appearing from over the horizon every time it gets a makeover.\nSo why does IBM not talk about Db2? To be fair, it does squeeze out some news if you know where to look.\nLast week at a North Carolina International Db2 User Group (IDUG) conference, IBM promised Db2 LUW v12 would include an AI-powered query optimizer, which would \"allow Db2 to continuously learn from customer's queries and achieve up to three times query performance improvement over prior version.\"\nAI query optimization in IBM's Db2 shows you can teach a tech dinosaur new tricks\nCodd almighty! Has it been half a century of SQL already?\nCockroachDB tempts legacy databases to crawl into the cloud age\nGoogle flaunts concurrency, optimization as cloud rivals overhaul platforms\nIn November last year, Db2 became available as an AWS Relational Database Service (RDS), joining a family of databases on RDS that also includes PostgreSQL and MySQL. The announcement, however, came from AWS, not IBM.\nThe move followed a statement that IBM would attempt to execute a \"cloud-first\" strategy with Db2, although that too came from an IDUG conference.\nHowever, given the context of Db2 users supporting applications vital to their business, maybe IBM could have told the world more about their future in the cloud. The cloud, after all, is inescapable as a tech trend. Even if IBM talks directly to Db2 users, any signals from IBM about it outside of this group might give the wider tech world some confidence in its future.\nIBM may have its own reasons, but since it is seemingly unwilling to share them, we are left to speculate.\nThe tech industry is led by investors, rather than customers. And they expect growth – not just normal, steady, above-inflation growth. They expect hypergrowth, as characterized by former Snowflake CEO Frank Slootman in his book Amp It Up. The tome is all about hypergrowth for companies that focus on a \"land and expand\" strategy, targeting a niche market then bursting out into adjacent markets.\nIt sounds great on paper, and early Snowflake investors were undoubtedly happy with the concept when Snowflake achieved a $120 billion valuation not long after its 2020 IPO, when it was briefly valued at more than IBM.\nBut Snowflake's flurry did not last. Its shares slid from the end of 2021, and it has barely made any gains since. Not that that would concern Slootman, who left the company in February, leaving investors wondering what sales forecast are based on now that its biggest customers have cut spending by optimizing deployments.\nDb2 is so well established in its market that it could never exhibit Snowflake's kind of growth, yet it still sits just two places behind Snowflake in the DB-Engines ranking (ninth place).\nCompare Db2's fate with another relational database with long-established roots. Postgres was launched not long after Db2 in 1986. After a promising commercial edition stumbled, open source PostgreSQL steadily grew, and today it enjoys a commanding position as the leading database for professional developers and fourth place in the DB-Engine's rankings.\nNot only is PostgreSQL successful in itself, it has also become the front end for other database services for the larger cloud vendors, and companies such as CockroachDB and Yugabyte. Some commentators see it becoming a de facto standard front end, while vendors innovate on the back end. That ship may have sailed for Db2, and IBM might rue the decision to let others tell its story. ®",

Early adopters are leading the way, with 59% of responding enterprises already working with AI intending to accelerate and increase investment in the technology. Ongoing challenges for AI adoption in enterprises remain, including hiring employees with the right skillsets, data complexity, and ethical concerns continue to inhibit businesses from adopting AI technologies into their operations.\nExperience the interactive Multimedia News Release here: https://www.multivu.com/players/English/9240059-ibm-2023-global-ai-adoption-index-report/\n\"We're seeing that the early adopters who overcame barriers to deploy AI are making further investments, proving to me that they are already experiencing the benefits from AI. More accessible AI tools, the drive for automation of key processes, and increasing amounts of AI embedded into off-the-shelf business applications are top factors driving the expansion of AI at the enterprise level,\" said Rob Thomas, Senior Vice President, IBM Software. \"We see organizations leveraging AI for use cases where I believe the technology can most quickly have a profound impact like IT automation, digital labor, and customer care. For the 40% of companies surveyed stuck in the sandbox, I am confident 2024 will be the year of tackling and overcoming barriers to entry like the skills gap and data complexity.\"\nHighlights from the \"IBM Global AI Adoption Index 2023,\" conducted by Morning Consult on behalf of IBM, include:\nOver the last several years, AI adoption has remained steady at large organizations surveyed:\nToday, 42% of IT professionals at large organizations report that they have actively deployed AI while an additional 40% are actively exploring using the technology.\nAdditionally, 38% of IT professionals at enterprises report that their company is actively implementing generative AI and another 42% are exploring it.\nOrganizations in India (59%), the UAE (58%), Singapore (53%), and China (50%) are leading the way in active use of AI, compared with lagging markets like Spain (28%), Australia (29%), and France (26%).\nCompanies within the financial services industry are most likely to be using AI, with about half of IT professionals within that industry reporting their company has actively deployed AI. 37% of IT professionals within the telecommunications industry state that their company is also deploying AI.\nThe majority of surveyed companies actively deploying or exploring AI have accelerated their rollout or investments in the past 24 months:\n59% of IT professionals at companies deploying or exploring AI indicate that their company has accelerated their investments in or rollout of AI in the past 24 months.\nChina (85%), India (74%), and the UAE (72%) are the markets most likely to be accelerating AI rollout, while businesses in the UK (40%), Australia (38%) and Canada (35%) were the least likely to accelerate the rollout.\nResearch and development (44%) and reskilling/workforce development (39%) are the top AI investments at organizations exploring or deploying AI.\nEasier to use AI tools and the need to reduce costs and automate processes are driving AI adoption among surveyed companies:\nAdvances in AI tools that make them more accessible (45%), the need to reduce costs and automate key processes (42%), and the increasing amount of AI embedded into standard off the shelf business applications (37%) are the top factors driving AI adoption.\nFor IT professionals, the two most important changes to AI in recent years are solutions that are easier to deploy (43%) and the increased prevalence of data, AI, and automation skills (42%).\nThe AI use cases driving adoption for surveyed companies currently exploring or deploying AI are not limited, but cut across many key areas of business operations:\nAutomating processing, understanding, and flow of documents (24%)\nAutomating customer or employee self-service answers and actions (23%)\nHuman resources and talent acquisition (19%)\nThe same set of barriers are keeping the next wave of surveyed companies from benefiting from AI:\nThe top barriers hindering successful AI adoption at enterprises both exploring or deploying AI are limited AI skills and expertise (33%), too much data complexity (25%), ethical concerns (23%), AI projects that are too difficult to integrate and scale (22%), high price (21%), and lack of tools for AI model development (21%).\nGenerative AI poses different barriers to entry from traditional AI models:\nData privacy (57%) and trust and transparency (43%) concerns are the biggest inhibitors of generative AI according to IT professionals at surveyed organizations not exploring or implementing generative AI.\n35% also say that lack of skills for implementation are a big inhibitor.\nAmong surveyed organizations, AI is already having an impact on the workforce:\nOne-in-five organizations report they do not have employees with the right skills in place to use new AI or automation tools and 16% cannot find new hires with the skills to address that gap.\nAmong companies citing AI's use to address labor or skills shortages, they are tapping AI to do things like reduce manual or repetitive tasks with automation tools (55%) or automate customer self-service answers and actions (47%).\nOnly 34% are currently training or reskilling employees to work together with new automation and AI tools.\nThe need for trustworthy and governed AI is understood by IT professionals, but barriers are making it difficult for surveyed companies to put into practice:\nIT professionals are largely in agreement that consumers are more likely to choose services from companies with transparent and ethical AI practices (85% strongly or somewhat agree) and say being able to explain how their AI reached a decision is important to their business (83% among companies exploring or deploying AI).\nBut, with many companies already deploying AI facing multiple barriers in the process, well under half report they are taking key steps towards trustworthy AI like reducing bias (27%), tracking data provenance (37%), making sure they can explain the decisions of their AI models (41%), or developing ethical AI policies (44%).\nThis survey was conducted in November 2023 among a representative sample of 8,584 IT Professionals in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, UAE, UK, US and LATAM (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru). To qualify for the survey, participants must be employed full-time, work at companies with more than 1 employee, work in a manager or higher-level role, and have at least some knowledge about how IT operates and is used by their company. The global results have a margin of error of +/- 1 percentage point.\nIBM is a leading provider of global hybrid cloud and AI, and consulting expertise.

    "content": "By Chris Wolf, Vice President, VMware AI Labs & Tarun Chopra, Vice President, Product Management, Data & AI, IBMIBM and VMware are working together to bring IBM watsonx to on premises environments on VMware Private AI and Red Hat OpenShift, to help enable fast, transparent generative AI capabilities.In 2023, we’ve seen AI adoption become mainstream as enterprises seek to drive transformative innovations. Generative AI, in particular, has captured the imagination of organizations as a means to generate new content based on a variety of inputs. Generative AI use cases and tasks are far-ranging – from code generation to contact centers resolution experience, IT operations automation, information retrieval and content creation.At the heart of all AI use cases is data—more importantly, access to and processing of the required data to net the best results from AI models. Enterprises need to be able to bring compute capacity and AI models to where enterprise data is created, processed, and consumed—in support of AI use cases—including both traditional AI/ML workloads and generative AI. Enterprises also need access to a full technology stack that allows for traditional enterprise-grade requirements, such as the use of confidential computing and the ability to train, tune, and deploy AI models all in one place that can run across cloud environments.This is the promise of Private AI, an architectural approach that aims to balance the business gains from AI with the privacy and compliance needs of the organization. It focuses on the platform and infrastructure architecture built in support of AI, which can be deployed in public clouds, virtual private clouds, data centers, and edge sites.VMware Private AI with IBM Bring Flexibility to Generative AIIBM and VMware provide enterprise customers the flexibility to enable generative AI use cases where your mission-critical operations reside. That’s why IBM and VMware are pairing VMware Cloud Foundation, Red Hat OpenShift and the IBM watsonx AI and data platform. This combination will enable enterprises to access IBM watsonx in private, on-premises Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) environments as well as hybrid cloud with watsonx SaaS offerings on IBM Cloud. Mutual clients will be able to utilize IBM watsonx AI capabilities, data management, and in the near future, its governance capabilities across public clouds, virtual private clouds, data centers, and edge sites, helping to enable transparent and explainable AI models.VMware Private AI is available across hybrid multi-cloud deployment. By using Red Hat OpenShift, clients can now bring watsonx on prem for VMware deployed workloads. Mutual clients will be able to access the full spectrum of the watsonx platform, which offers products to help clients accelerate and scale AI. Clients can optionally use IBM Cloud Satellite to automate and simplify deployment and day two operations of their VMware Private AI with OpenShift environments.Partnership Committed to Delivering the Value of Multi-cloudThis collaboration was born out of the IBM and VMware Joint Innovation Lab, a co-innovation engine with a dedicated team of engineers who have a mission to build upon the strengths of both companies and solve client problems by bringing new offerings to market. The lab, announced in 2018, has since completed numerous hybrid cloud and AI-focused projects to date.VMware and IBM plan to develop a validated reference architecture to allow for mutual clients to leverage hybrid cloud and on-prem environments subject to regulation for the training and fine-tuning of ML models – including Large Language Models (LLMs) for generative AI use cases. For example, moving data from a bank or financial institution in one country to a hyperscaler could be prohibited due to regulatory restrictions or the data is too large, and attempting to transfer it from one location to another would be impossible.IBM Consulting Provides Clients with Expertise in VMware specific solutions and Generative AIEarlier this year, IBM Consulting established a Center of Excellence for generative AI and now has more than 1,000 consultants with specialized generative AI expertise who are engaging with a global set of clients to drive productivity in IT operations and core business processes like HR or marketing, to elevate their customer experiences and create new business models.This, combined with IBM Consulting's extensive VMware-specific expertise and service capabilities will help accelerate our clients’ business transformations with enterprise-grade AI on the VMware Private AI reference architecture.Additionally, for clients looking to modernize and transform their workloads, IBM Consulting plans to integrate IBM watsonx and VMware Private AI services into its proprietary IBM Consulting Cloud Accelerator to help accelerate the cloud transformation process. Once released, this integration will help with reverse engineering, code generation and code conversion while helping to manage the day two operations and beyond for seamless Hybrid Cloud management services from IBM Consulting.Enabling Clients’ Generative AI FutureThe strategic partnership between IBM and VMware aims to enable mutual clients to embrace hybrid cloud through flexible consumption models and modernize their mission-critical workloads. Clients can also benefit from having IBM Consulting as a strategic partner on this journey. By having the choice of when, where, and how to integrate generative AI technologies with VMware Cloud Foundation, enterprises will be empowered to quickly train and deploy custom AI capabilities across their enterprise while retaining control over their data. They also gain a powerful guide to leveraging the best innovations from VMware’s software offerings in a unified stack to deliver a consistent environment integrated with the data and AI capabilities brought by IBM Cloud partner technology.Disclaimer: VMware and IBM make no guarantee that services announced in preview or beta will become available at a future date.

    "content": "ARMONK, N.Y., May 21, 2024 – Today, at its annual THINK conference, IBM (NYSE: IBM) announced several new updates to its watsonx platform one year after its introduction, as well as upcoming data and automation capabilities designed to make artificial intelligence (AI) more open, cost effective, and flexible for businesses. During his opening keynote, CEO Arvind Krishna will share the company’s plans to invest in, build and contribute to the open-source AI community as a core part of IBM’s strategy.\n“We firmly believe in bringing open innovation to AI. We want to use the power of open source to do with AI what was successfully done with Linux and OpenShift,” said Krishna. “Open means choice. Open means more eyes on the code, more minds on the problems, and more hands on the solutions. For any technology to gain velocity and become ubiquitous, you’ve got to balance three things: competition, innovation, and safety. Open source is a great way to achieve all three.”\nIBM released a family of Granite models into open source and launched InstructLab, a first-of-its-kind capability, in collaboration with Red Hat\nFurthering its commitment to the open-source AI ecosystem, IBM has now open-sourced a family of its most advanced and performant language and code Granite models. By open sourcing these models, IBM is inviting clients, developers and global experts to build on these strengths and push the boundaries of what AI can achieve in enterprise environments.\nAvailable today under Apache 2.0 licenses on Hugging Face and GitHub, the open-source Granite models stand out for their development process, quality, transparency and efficiency. The Granite code models range from 3B to 34B parameters and come in both base and instruction-following model variants, which are suitable for tasks such as complex application modernization, code generation, fixing bugs, explaining and documenting code, maintaining repositories and more. The code models, trained on 116 programming languages, consistently reach state-of-the-art performance among open-source code LLMs across various code-related tasks[i]:\nTesting by IBM found that the Granite Code models overall show very strong performance across all model sizes and benchmarks, often outperforming other open-source code models that are twice as large compared to Granite.[ii]\nTesting by IBM on benchmarks including HumanEvalPack, HumanEvalPlus, and reasoning benchmark GSM8K showed Granite code models have strong performances on code synthesis, fixing, explanation, editing, and translation across most major programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, C++, and Rust.[iii]\nThe 20B parameter Granite base code model was used to train IBM watsonx Code Assistant (WCA) for specialized domains. It also powers watsonx Code Assistant for Z — a product designed to help enterprises transform monolithic COBOL applications into services optimized for IBM Z.\nThe 20B parameter Granite base code model was tuned to generate SQL from natural language questions for the purpose of transforming structured data and extracting insights from that data. IBM demonstrated leadership in natural language to SQL, an important industry use case, as benchmarked by BIRD's independent leaderboard, which ranks models according to Execution Accuracy (EX) and Valid Efficiency Score (VES).[iv]\nIBM and Red Hat also recently launched InstructLab — a revolutionary approach to advancing true open-source innovation around LLMs.\nThe InstructLab methodology allows for continuous development of base models through constant incremental contributions, much like software development has worked in open source for decades. With InstructLab, developers can build models specific to their business domains or industries with their own data, so that they can see the direct value of AI rather than just the model providers seeing the value. IBM plans to harness these open-source contributions to bring additional value to its clients through integrations with watsonx.ai and the new Red Hat Enterprise Linux AI (RHEL AI) solution.\nIBM unveils a new class of watsonx assistants\nThis new wave of AI innovation has the potential to unlock an estimated $4 trillion in annual economic benefits across industries.[v] However, IBM’s annual Global AI Adoption Index recently found that while 42% of enterprise-scale companies (> 1,000 employees) surveyed have implemented AI in their business, another 40% of those companies that are exploring or experimenting with AI have yet to deploy their models. For the companies stuck in the sandbox, 2024 is the year of overcoming barriers to entry such as the skills gap, data complexity and – perhaps most importantly – trust.\nTo address these challenges, IBM is announcing several upcoming updates and enhancements to its family of watsonx assistants, along with an upcoming capability in watsonx Orchestrate to help clients build their own AI Assistants across domains.\nThe new AI Assistants include watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications (planned availability in October 2024), watsonx Assistant for Z to transform how users interact with the system to quickly transfer knowledge and expertise (planned availability in June 2024), and an expansion of watsonx Code Assistant for Z Service with code explanation to help clients understand and document applications through natural language (planned availability in June 2024).

    "content": "Cyberattacks are an existential risk, with 89% of organizations ranking ransomware as one of the top five threats to their viability, according to a November 2023 report from TechTarget’s...Cyberattacks are an existential risk, with 89% of organizations ranking ransomware as one of the top five threats to their viability, according to a November 2023 report from TechTarget’s Enterprise Strategy Group, a leading analyst firm.[1] And this is just one of many risks to corporate data – insider threats, data exfiltration, hardware failures, and natural disasters also pose significant danger. Moreover, as the just-released 2024 IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Index states, as the generative AI market becomes more established, it could trigger the maturity of AI as an attack surface, mobilizing even further investment in new tools from cybercriminals. The report notes that enterprises should also recognize that their existing underlying infrastructure is a gateway to their AI models that doesn’t require novel tactics from attackers to target.[2]\nTo help clients counter these threats with earlier and more accurate detection, we’re announcing new AI-enhanced versions of the IBM FlashCore Module technology available inside new IBM Storage FlashSystem products and a new version of IBM Storage Defender software to help organizations improve their ability to detect and respond to ransomware and other cyberattacks that threaten their data.\nThe newly available fourth generation of FlashCore Module (FCM) technology enables artificial intelligence capabilities within the IBM Storage FlashSystem family. FCM works with Storage Defender to provide end-to-end data resilience across primary and secondary workloads with AI-powered sensors designed for earlier notification of cyber threats to help enterprises recover faster.\nEarly Detection of Threats in the Data Stream\nExisting IBM FlashSystem products scan all incoming data down to block level granularity without impact to performance as it’s being written, using inline data corruption detection software and cloud-based AI to help identify anomalies that might indicate the start of a cyberattack, thereby enabling the system to detect, respond, and rapidly recover with immutable copies. The new technology enabled by FCM4 is designed to continuously monitor statistics gathered from every single I/O using machine learning models to detect anomalies like ransomware in less than a minute.[3]\n“Cyber threats evolve rapidly, making early detection a critical step when we help clients respond to attacks,” said Daneyand “DJ” Singley, Executive Director at MAPSYS. “We’ve turned to IBM FlashSystem and FCM3 to help our clients achieve rapid recovery, and with the new FCM4 technology in new FlashSystem arrays, we anticipate the ability to take immediate action to thwart attacks.”\nIBM FlashSystem products already measure parameters such as the compressibility and randomness, or entropy of data, and pass this information to IBM Storage Insights software so that it can alert operators when a workload anomaly has been detected, such as ransomware starting to encrypt an application’s data. The FCM4 technology in new FlashSystem arrays is designed to capture and summarize detailed statistics about every I/O in real time. FlashSystem uses machine learning models to distinguish ransomware and malware from normal behavior, positioning organizations to take action and keep operating in the event of an attack.\n\"Organizations need to take a 'defense in depth' approach against ransomware and other cyberattacks, especially as malware becomes increasingly sophisticated,” said Dave Pearson, Research VP, Infrastructure, IDC. “Storage infrastructure is another layer where cyber resilience can improve, and IBM built its new FlashCore Module 4 with AI-based capabilities designed to speed ransomware detection, reduce the spread and impact, and accelerate recovery.\"\nGetting Smarter at Identifying Threats Across Workloads\nIBM Storage Defender software offers end-to-end data resilience in modern hybrid multi-cloud IT environments that includes virtual machines (VMs), databases, applications, file systems, SaaS workloads, and containers. The new version of IBM Storage Defender expands its threat detection capabilities to help build trustworthiness of copies as a baseline for teams to begin recovery from cyberattacks. Additionally, IBM Storage Defender includes AI-powered sensors developed by IBM Research that are engineered to rapidly detect ransomware and other advanced threats with high accuracy. Defender raises high fidelity alerts to security tools to reduce the security breach blast radius and help enterprises recover from attacks.\nWe’ve added workload and storage inventory management capabilities to IBM Storage Defender designed to help organizations assess the extent of their applications and data. This can help them incorporate their assets in a business continuity plan to recover a minimum viable company after a cyberattack. Defender also adds the ability to orchestrate and automate the recovery of VMware applications.\nPart of Defender’s appeal is the ease with which it integrates with other IBM Storage and IBM Security solutions, including IBM QRadar, IBM Guardium, IBM FlashSystem, IBM Storage Scale, IBM Storage Ceph, and IBM Fusion. Beyond IBM solutions, Defender integrates with Cohesity and will integrate with other third-party data platforms to bring end to end data resilience across the enterprise data estate.\nIndividually, both FlashSystem and Defender have capabilities that can help make organizations more data resilient, but they’re even better together. For example, storage administrators can now create protection groups that include specific volumes and are automatically backed up according to user-defined policies. Immutable copies of data  can now be restored or recovered to multiple target locations, including different locations when recovering from a cyberattack. Plus, immutable copies can be replicated to another IBM Storage Defender cluster for an additional layer of protection.\nWe’ve also engineered settings that allow administrators to automate the creation of Safeguarded Copy snapshots, cyber-resilient point-in-time copies of data that cannot be changed or deleted through user errors, malicious actions, or cyberattacks. Isolating these backup copies from production data is designed to enable organizations to recover data more quickly after a data loss event.\nNews reports show that threat actors are now deploying AI-based cyberattacks, and we must fight fire with fire. Our new FlashCore Module hardware and Storage Defender software both leverage IBM’s AI capabilities to help them better address this challenge. The IBM product portfolio is not only helping to deliver comprehensive data resilience to clients, including many of the world’s largest financial and health care organizations, to help them avoid threats in the first place, but also helping them accelerate the recovery process in the event that attackers have been able to get through.\n[1] 2023 Ransomware Preparedness: Lighting the Way to Readiness and Mitigation, published by Enterprise Strategy Group / TechTarget, November 2023\n[3] Disclaimer: Internal experimentation by IBM Research has demonstrated detection of ransomware within 1 minute of the ransomware starting its encryption process. This experiment was done on a FlashSystem 5200 with 6 FCMs with the 4.1 firmware load. The 5200 had 8.6.3 GA level software loaded. The host connected to the 5200 was running Linux with XFS Filesystem. In this particular case, the IBM ransomware simulator called WannaLaugh was used. Underlying system must be compatible with FCM4.1 and version 8.6.3 GA level software loaded in order to receive results obtained.",

    "content": "Effort aims to widen access to NASA earth science data for geospatial intelligence and accelerate climate-related discoveries\nYORKTOWN HEIGHTS, N.Y., Aug. 3, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) and open-source AI platform Hugging Face today announced that IBM's watsonx.ai geospatial foundation model – built from NASA's satellite data – will now be openly available on Hugging Face. It will be the largest geospatial foundation model on Hugging Face and the first-ever open-source AI foundation model built in collaboration with NASA.\nAccess to the latest data remains a significant challenge in climate science where environmental conditions change almost daily. And, despite growing amounts of data — estimates from NASA suggest that by 2024, scientists will have 250,000 terabytes of data from new missions — scientists and researchers still face obstacles in analyzing these large datasets. As part of a Space Act Agreement with NASA, IBM set out earlier this year to build an AI foundation model for geospatial data. And now, by making a geospatial foundation model available via Hugging Face — a recognized leader in open-source and a well-known repository for all transformer models — efforts can advance to democratize access and application of AI to generate new innovations in climate and Earth science.\n\"The essential role of open-source technologies to accelerate critical areas of discovery such as climate change has never been clearer,\" said Sriram Raghavan, Vice President, IBM Research AI. \"By combining IBM's foundation model efforts aimed at creating flexible, reusable AI systems with NASA's repository of Earth-satellite data, and making it available on the leading open-source AI platform, Hugging Face, we can leverage the power of collaboration to implement faster and more impactful solutions that will improve our planet.\"\n\"AI remains a science-driven field, and science can only progress through information sharing and collaboration,\" said Jeff Boudier, head of product and growth at Hugging Face. \"This is why open-source AI and the open release of models and datasets are so fundamental to the continued progress of AI, and making sure the technology will benefit as many people as possible.\"\n\"We believe that foundation models have the potential to change the way observational data is analyzed and help us to better understand our planet,\" said Kevin Murphy, Chief Science Data Officer, NASA. \"And by open sourcing such models and making them available to the world, we hope to multiply their impact.\"\nThe model – trained jointly by IBM and NASA on Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 satellite data (HLS) over one year across the continental United States and fine-tuned on labeled data for flood and burn scar mapping — has demonstrated to date a 15 percent improvement over state-of-the-art techniques using half as much labeled data. With additional fine tuning, the base model can be redeployed for tasks like tracking deforestation, predicting crop yields, or detecting and monitoring greenhouse gasses. IBM and NASA researchers are also working with Clark University to adapt the model for applications such as time-series segmentation and similarity research.\nThe news follows IBM's announcement earlier this year to collaborate with NASA to build an AI model that could speed up the analysis of satellite images and boost scientific discovery. It's also part of NASA's decade-long Open-Source Science Initiative to build a more accessible, inclusive, and collaborative scientific community. NASA, along with the White House and other federal agencies, has declared 2023 a Year of Open Science to celebrate the benefits and successes created through the open sharing of data, information, and knowledge.\nThe model leverages IBM foundation model technology and is part of IBM's larger effort to create and train AI models that can be used for different tasks and apply information from one situation to another. In July, IBM announced the availability of watsonx, an AI and data platform that allows enterprises to scale and accelerate impact of the most advanced AI with trusted data. A commercial version of the geospatial model, which is part of IBM watsonx, will be available through the IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite (EIS) later this year.\nStatements regarding IBM's future direction and intent are subject to change or withdrawal without notice, and represent goals and objectives only.\nIBM is a leading provider of global hybrid cloud and AI, and consulting expertise.

    "content": "We’re in the midst of a Cambrian explosion in AI. Over the last decade, AI has gone from theory and small tests to enterprise-scale use cases. But the hardware used to run AI systems, although increasingly powerful, was not designed with today’s AI in mind. As AI systems scale, the costs skyrocket. And Moore’s Law, the theory that the density of circuits in processors would double every two years, has slowed.But new research out of IBM Research’s lab in Almaden, California, nearly two decades in the making, has the potential to drastically shift how we can efficiently scale up powerful AI hardware systems.Since the birth of the semiconductor industry, computer chips have primarily followed the same basic structure, where the processing units and the memory storing the information to be processed are stored discretely. While this structure has allowed for simpler designs that have been able to scale well over the decades, it’s created what’s called the von Neumann bottleneck, where it takes time and energy to continually shuffle data back and forth between memory, processing, and any other devices within a chip. The work by IBM Research’s Dharmendra Modha and his colleagues aims to change this, taking inspiration from how the brain computes. “It forges a completely different path from the von Neumann architecture,” according to Modha.Over the last eight years, Modha has been working on a new type of digital AI chip for neural inference, which he calls NorthPole. It’s an extension of TrueNorth, the last brain-inspired chip that Modha worked on prior to 2014. In tests on the popular ResNet-50 image recognition and YOLOv4 object detection models, the new prototype device has demonstrated higher energy efficiency, higher space efficiency, and lower latency than any other chip currently on the market, and is roughly 4,000 times faster than TrueNorth.The first promising set of results from NorthPole chips were published today in Science. NorthPole is a breakthrough in chip architecture that delivers massive improvements in energy, space, and time efficiencies, according to Modha. Using the ResNet-50 model as a benchmark, NorthPole is considerably more efficient than common 12-nm GPUs and 14-nm CPUs. (NorthPole itself is built on 12 nm node processing technology.) In both cases, NorthPole is 25 times more energy efficient, when it comes to the number of frames interpreted per joule of power required. NorthPole also outperformed in latency, as well as space required to compute, in terms of frames interpreted per second per billion transistors required. According to Modha, on ResNet-50, NorthPole outperforms all major prevalent architectures — even those that use more advanced technology processes, such as a GPU implemented using a 4 nm process.How does it manage to compute with so much more efficiency than existing chips? One of the biggest differences with NorthPole is that all of the memory for the device is on the chip itself, rather than connected separately. Without that von Neumann bottleneck, the chip can carry out AI inferencing considerably faster than other chips already on the market. NorthPole was fabricated with a 12-nm node process, and contains 22 billion transistors in 800 square millimeters. It has 256 cores and can perform 2,048 operations per core per cycle at 8-bit precision, with potential to double and quadruple the number of operations with 4-bit and 2-bit precision, respectively. “It’s an entire network on a chip,” Modha said.Working on a NorthPole chip on a PCIe card.“Architecturally, NorthPole blurs the boundary between compute and memory,” Modha said. \"At the level of individual cores, NorthPole appears as memory-near-compute and from outside the chip, at the level of input-output, it appears as an active memory.” This makes NorthPole easy to integrate in systems and significantly reduces load on the host machine.But the biggest advantage of NorthPole is also a constraint: it can only easily pull from the memory it has onboard. All of the speedups that are possible on the chip would be undercut if it had to access information from another place. Via an approach called scale-out, NorthPole can actually support larger neural networks by breaking them down into smaller sub-networks that fit within NorthPole’s model memory, and connecting these sub-networks together on multiple NorthPole chips. So while there is ample memory on a NorthPole (or collectively on a set of NorthPoles) for many of the models that would be useful for specific applications, this chip is not meant to be a jack of all trades. “We can’t run GPT-4 on this, but we could serve many of the models enterprises need,” Modha said. “And, of course, NorthPole is only for inferencing.”This efficacy means that the device also doesn’t need bulky liquid-cooling systems to run — fans and heat sinks are more than enough — meaning that it could be deployed in some rather small spaces.Potential applications for NorthPoleWhile research into the NorthPole chip is still ongoing, its structure lends itself to emerging AI use cases, as well as more well-established ones.In testing, NorthPole team focused primarily on computer vision-related uses, in part because funding for the project came from the U.S. Department of Defense. Some of the primary applications in consideration were detection, image segmentation, and video classification. But it was also tested in other arenas, such as natural language processing (on the encoder-only BERT model) and speech recognition (on the DeepSpeech2 model). The team is currently exploring mapping decoder-only large language models to NorthPole scale-out systems.When you think of these AI tasks, all sorts of fantastical use cases spring to mind, from autonomous vehicles, to robotics, digital assistants, or spatial computing. Many sorts of edge applications that require massive amounts of data processing in real time could be well-suited for NorthPole. For example, it could potentially be the sort of device that’s needed to move autonomous vehicles from machines that require set maps and routes to operate on a small scale, to ones that can think and react to the rare edge-case situations that make navigating in the real world so challenging even for proficient human drivers. These sorts of edge-cases are the exact sweet spot for future NorthPole applications. NorthPole could enable satellites that monitor agriculture and manage wildlife populations, monitor vehicle and freight for safer and less congested roads, operate robots safely, and detect cyber threats for safer businesses.What’s nextThis is just the start of the work for Modha on NorthPole. The current state of the art for CPUs is 3 nm — and IBM itself is already years into research on 2 nm nodes. That means there’s a handful of generations of chip processing technologies NorthPole could be implemented on, in addition to fundamental architectural innovations, to keep finding efficiency and performance gains.Modha discussing NorthPole in the Almaden lab.But for Modha, this is just one important milestone along a continuum that has dominated the last 19 years of his professional career. He’s been working on digital brain-inspired chips throughout that time, knowing that the brain is the most energy-efficient processor we know, and searching for ways to replicate that digitally. TrueNorth was fully inspired by the structures of neurons in the brain — and had as many digital “synapses” in it as the brain of a bee. But sitting on a park bench in 2015 in San Francisco, Modha said he was thinking through his work to date. He had the belief that there was something in marrying the best of traditional processing devices with the structure of processing in the brain, where memory and processing are interspersed throughout the brain. The answer was “brain-inspired computing, with silicon speed,” according to Modha.Over the next eight years, Modha and his colleagues were single-minded and hermetic in their goal of turning this vision into a reality. Toiling inconspicuously in Almaden, the team didn’t give any lectures or publish any papers on their work, until this year. Each person brought different skills and perspective yet everyone collaborated so that as a whole the team’s contribution was much greater than the sum of the parts. Now, the plan is to show what NorthPole could do, while exploring how to translate the designs into smaller chip production processes and further exploring the architectural possibilities.This work stemmed from simple ideas — how can we make computers that work like the brain — and after years of fundamental research, has come up with an answer.  Something that is really only possible today at a place like IBM Research, where there is the time and space to explore the big questions in computing, and where they can take us. “NorthPole is a faint representation of the brain in the mirror of a silicon wafer,” Modha said.Modha, center, with most of the team working on NorthPole.",

    "content": "Foundation models are fast becoming indispensable tools for writing code, translating languages, and summarizing virtually any text, no matter how complex. Predicting the weather and climate could be next.Fed enough raw data, foundation models can piece together the underlying structure of complex systems, whether that’s code, natural language, or molecules. From this general base of knowledge, a single foundation model can perform many tasks with additional training and task-specific examples. Their power lies in their ability, when prompted, to generate predictions or original content with limited instructions from humans.The essential ingredient is data, which is something NASA has in abundance. To make NASA’s vast and growing data archive more accessible, IBM and NASA set out a year ago to build an open-source geospatial foundation model. Now available on Hugging Face, the model can help scientists estimate the extent of past floods and wildfires. IBM is also using the model to help map urban heat islands in the UAE and track reforestation in Kenya.Encouraged by these results, IBM and NASA decided to branch out. A new foundation model aimed at making weather and climate applications faster, more accurate, and more accessible is now in the works. Other potential applications include helping climate experts infer high-resolution information from low-res data, identify conditions conducive to wildfires, and predict hurricanes, droughts, and other extreme events.In September, IBM and NASA hosted a workshop to discuss their proposed roadmap for building a weather and climate foundation model. When finished, the model will be made open source and publicly available.The renaissance in weather forecastingWeather prediction has improved dramatically in recent decades. Today’s six-day forecast is as accurate as a five-day forecast 10 years ago. Hurricane tracks can be predicted more accurately three days out than they were 24 hours in advance 40 years ago.This remarkable achievement is due to two things: decades of advances in atmosphere and ocean science and parallel progress in high-performance computing. Modern weather models base their predictions on massive computer simulations that take time and energy to run. That’s because they factor in both physics-based equations and weather observations, from winds and air pressure to temperature and precipitation.But now, another revolution is underway. In the last year, a new way of forecasting the weather has emerged. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) has started using several deep-learning models called AI emulators that generate forecasts based on historical weather patterns; the laws of physics are not explicitly encoded in AI emulators, but they can be inferred from the data. This simplicity means that a forecast can be dashed off on a desktop computer in minutes instead of the hours it can take an HPC system.Google Deep Mind recently reported that its GraphCast emulator could provide a faster, more accurate 10-day forecast than current traditional models. In September, GraphCast accurately predicted that Hurricane Lee would make landfall in Nova Scotia nine days in advance — three days earlier than current models.Technically, AI emulators are not foundation models. They were trained to perform one task, on one dataset, and were given explicit forecasting instructions. But they are the precursors to a general-purpose foundation model and hint at the benefits to come.A multimodal foundation model for weather and climateFoundation models have several advantages that come from their ability to process and analyze raw data of many types, allowing them to form a broad representation of the data that can be generalized to many scenarios. It’s an important capability in a field like climate, where conditions are constantly changing through time and space, and many downstream applications exist beyond forecasting.Foundation models can take tens of thousands of GPU hours to train. But at inference time, they can be run in minutes to seconds. Currently, not many researchers have access to HPC computing resources to run traditional weather models. The emergence of pre-trained AI models means that the field of weather and climate modeling has effectively been democratized. This brings the potential for accelerated discovery.Foundation models could also improve the accuracy of forecasting for other climate applications. Earth’s climate is changing rapidly and disrupting weather patterns globally. For logistics, businesses, and government agencies, the earlier that a pending disaster can be detected, the greater the chance that lives and money can be saved.Inferring atmospheric dynamics from the dataTo be foundational, a foundation model can’t be a one-trick pony. It should be capable of performing many tasks, and ideally, trained on many types of data. This is especially important in weather and climate prediction since many physical processes can often only be observed over certain timeframes and spatial scales. The cyclic El Niño weather pattern, for example, plays out over many months and across half the globe, while tornado initiation can take minutes and arise from processes at the sub-meter scale.Sensors provide a continuous, highly localized record of changing temperatures, winds, and pressure. Satellite images, by contrast, capture environmental changes at longer intervals and lower resolution.IBM and NASA's proposed foundation model will initially be trained on the MERRA-2 dataset, a combination of high-quality observations and estimates of past weather over the last 40 years. Observational data from fixed weather stations, floating weather balloons, and planet-orbiting satellites will be added later. IBM and NASA are currently experimenting with model architectures and techniques to integrate these varying time and spatial scales into one multimodal model.Other challengesCurrent AI models often miss extreme events. This tendency is a known problem for AI models which are trained to ignore outliers. Loss functions minimize the chance of making big mistakes, but consequently they can also miss extreme events. Methods to correct this tendency have been implemented in smaller models. IBM and NASA's challenge will be to extend this work to large foundation models.Another issue is climate change itself. The past is not always a great predictor of the future, especially when the climate is warming as rapidly as it is today. A hurricane in 2024, for example, may have higher wind speeds than a hurricane in 1933. As a result, forecasters may not see it coming if their models are based exclusively on historical data. AI, however, makes it possible to continuously update models as circumstances evolve and new data becomes available.What’s nextIBM and NASA’s goal is to create a multimodal AI foundation model for weather and climate prediction that can be adapted to many downstream tasks with relatively few GPUs. AI experts at IBM will work closely with climate scientists and other domain experts at NASA to test and validate the model on seven applications, including 10-14 day weather forecasts and things like dust storms and aviation turbulence.Once trained, the model will be made openly available on Hugging Face, making weather and climate modeling much more accessible to the global research community. This work is part of a larger effort by IBM and NASA to develop foundation models that can answer some of the most pressing questions about our changing climate and environment.",

    "content": ",  /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced watsonx Code Assistant for Z, a new generative AI-assisted product that will help enable faster translation of COBOL to Java and enhances developer productivity on the platform. This product will be generally available in Q4 2023, and is being designed to help accelerate COBOL application modernization. Watsonx Code Assistant for Z will preview during TechXchange, IBM's premier technical learning event in Las Vegas, Sept 11-13.\nWatsonx Code Assistant for Z is a new addition to the watsonx Code Assistant product family, along with IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed, scheduled for release later this year. These solutions will be powered by IBM's watsonx.ai code model, which will have knowledge of 115 coding languages1 having learned from 1.5 trillion tokens.2 At 20 billion parameters, it is on target to become one of the largest generative AI foundation models for code automation.3 The watsonx Code Assistant product portfolio will extend over time to address other programming languages, to improve time to value for modernization and address growing skills challenges for developers.\nWatsonx Code Assistant for Z is being designed to assist businesses in leveraging generative AI and automated tooling to accelerate their mainframe application modernization – all with the goal of preserving the performance, security and resiliency capabilities of IBM Z.\nThe COBOL data processing language supports many vital business and operational processes at organizations globally. At scale, using watsonx Code Assistant for Z in comparison to other approaches could make it easier for developers to selectively and incrementally transform COBOL business services into well architected high-quality Java code – with estimated billions of lines of COBOL code as potential candidates for targeted modernization over time. Generative AI can help developers to more quickly assess, update, validate and test the right code, allowing them to more efficiently modernize large applications and focus on higher impact tasks.\nIBM is designing these capabilities to provide tooling for each step of the modernization journey. The solution is expected to include IBM's Application Discovery and Delivery Intelligence (ADDI) inventory and analysis tool. Following ADDI, key steps on the journey include refactoring business services in COBOL, transforming COBOL code to Java code with an optimized design, and validating the resulting outcome, including using automated testing capabilities. Potential benefits for clients include:\nAccelerating code development and increasing developer productivity throughout the application modernization lifecycle\nManaging total cost, complexity, and risk of application modernization initiatives, including translation and optimization of code in-place\nExpanding access to a broader pool of IT skills and accelerating developer onboarding\nAchieving high quality, easy to maintain code through model customization and the application of best practices\n\"Our collaboration with IBM is an important element in our drive to leverage generative AI interfaces to challenge legacy approaches with material productivity gains, and reinvent our Capital Markets solutions,\" said Roger Burkhardt, CTO, Capital Markets and AI, Broadridge Financial. \"We have had excellent client response to our generative AI investments and we are intrigued by the opportunity to further our efforts by leveraging IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Z to address a broader range of platforms.\"\nAI-assisted mainframe application modernization is an imperative\nAccording to new research from the IBM Institute for Business Value, organizations are 12x more likely to leverage existing mainframe assets rather than rebuild their application estates from scratch in the next two years. At the same time, however, the study shows that the number one challenge for those same organizations is a lack of resources and skills.\n\"By bringing generative AI capabilities through watsonx to new use cases, we plan to drive real progress for our clients,\" said Kareem Yusuf, PhD, Senior Vice President, Product Management and Growth, IBM Software. \"IBM is engineering watsonx Code Assistant for Z to take a targeted and optimized approach. It's built to rapidly and accurately convert code optimized for IBM Z, accelerate time to market and broaden the skills pool. This can help enhance applications and add new capabilities while preserving the performance, resiliency, and security inherent in IBM Z.\"\nThere are many application modernization approaches available today. Some options include rewriting all application code in Java, or migrating everything to public cloud, which may sacrifice capabilities that are core to the IBM Z value proposition while failing to deliver on expected cost reduction. Tools that convert COBOL applications to Java syntax can produce code that is hard to maintain and can be unrecognizable to a Java developer. Generative AI is promising, but current AI-assisted partial re-write technology lacks COBOL support and doesn't optimize the resulting Java code for the given task.\nThe resulting Java code from watsonx Code Assistant for Z will be object-oriented. IBM is designing this solution to be optimized to interoperate with the rest of the COBOL application, with CICS, IMS, DB2, and other z/OS runtimes. Java on Z is designed to be performance-optimized versus a compared x86 platform.4\nBuilding on a foundation of governance and innovation\nAccording to a 2023 Gartner® report (For Gartner Subscribers only), \"by 2028, the combination of humans and AI assistants working in tandem could reduce the time to complete coding tasks by 30%.\" The report further states that \"the use of AI code generation tools is not replacing the quality assurance (QA) processes and security controls that are needed by developers for robust and secure product development, as well as for mitigation of inherited risks from using generative methods for code.\"5\nProtecting sensitive data and customer intellectual property are critical when it comes to implementing generative AI. IBM for decades has followed core principles, grounded in commitments to Trust and Transparency. With this principle-based approach, the watsonx platform aims to enable enterprises to leverage their own trusted data and IP to build tailored AI solutions that are scalable across operations.\nAdditionally, IBM Consulting brings deep domain expertise in IBM Z application modernization with a focus on guiding clients that leverage the platform across key industries such as banking, insurance, healthcare and government. These dedicated consultants can help clients identify the right application areas to modernize in order to optimize the potential benefits of watsonx Code Assistant for Z.\nIBM's plans, directions, and intentions may change or be withdrawn at any time at IBM's discretion without notice.

    "content": "COBOL, the first programming language for business, helped build the modern software industry. Six decades later, COBOL-powered mainframes now process an estimated 70% of banking transactions globally.Applications based on COBOL have stuck around for as long as they have because of their security, reliability, and transactional performance. But keeping these applications maintained and updated is a growing challenge. There just aren’t as many COBOL coders as there used to be, and the rise of cloud computing has led to a shift towards modular business applications that tend to be written in Java.As enterprises look to modernize, they are looking for skilled developers that can understand mainframe applications, and use tools designed specifically to break up and transform complex, large mainframe applications.To simplify the mainframe modernization journey, IBM has developed watsonx Code Assistant for IBM Z, a solution powered by automated tooling and IBM’s 20-billion parameter “Granite” large language model for code that allows enterprises to transform monolithic COBOL applications into services optimized for IBM Z.Enterprises can selectively modernize applications with the greatest return and integrate them with existing services to maintain IBM Z’s high performance. IBM will make this solution available to customers on Thursday, October 26.“Generative AI can make modernization less overwhelming for enterprises,” said Ruchir Puri, chief scientist at IBM Research. “Watsonx Code Assistant for Z can help companies selectively and incrementally refactor business services in COBOL, prioritizing tasks with the greatest payoff first.”Modernization in less time, at lower costApplication modernization can be slow-going and risky, especially for banks and governments that provide mission-critical services. Large applications have interdependent features that have been repeatedly updated over the years. Disentangling them into stand-alone services can be complex and time-consuming. And once refactoring is complete, developers face the additional hurdle of translating those services from COBOL to Java.IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Z has several capabilities designed to save developers time and reduce the chance of mistakes. An application discovery tool analyzes the application and maps out its dependencies, giving developers a high-level understanding of how the code works. An automated refactoring tool takes this information and helps developers identify the business services they want to extract and refactor. Metadata collected during these first two steps provides critical context for a third capability, powered by generative AI, if the client chooses.A large language model (LLM), trained on the world’s programming languages and tuned on pairs of COBOL-Java programs for IBM Z, takes the refactored COBOL program and translates it to Java. An automated unit-testing tool, to be released later, will allow developers to quickly test and validate the newly transformed Java code.The solution is designed to operate with the full suite of Z/OS applications and environments.Generative AI-assisted mainframe application modernizationHigh-quality, ‘JOBOL’-free codeIBM trained the base model on open-source code repositories like GitHub, after extensive filtering for toxic, sensitive, or copyright-protected code. In total, more than 1.6 trillion code tokens (words and parts of words) went into training the base Granite model. To strengthen the model’s understanding of COBOL and Java, it was fine-tuned on thousands of pairs of enterprise programs in both languages. Critical gaps were filled in with AI-generated synthetic code.When comparing between watsonx Code Assistant for IBM Z and ChatGPT (OpenAI’s LLM-powered chatbot), IBM researchers found that WCA for Z outperformed ChatGPT on COBOL translation.Several factors explain the IBM Granite model’s high performance:The first is the quality of the data used to tune and customize the model. IBM programmers fluent in COBOL and Java worked side-by-side to create thousands of pairs of functionally equivalent programs for IBM Z.It turns out that translating code literally, line-by-line, works about as well for programs as it does for natural language. Translate COBOL to Java this way and you get ‘JOBOL,’ code that’s difficult to read and maintain. IBM programmers worked carefully to ensure that the syntax of each COBOL program was expressed correctly in Java.“We know Cobol and Java on z/OS better than anyone,” said Richard Larin, product lead for IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Z. “We’re imparting that knowledge to our large language model so it knows how to handle our customers’ use cases.”Sometimes that means keeping a microservice in COBOL, and not translating it to Java. “It can mix and match,” Puri said. “Since IBM Z supports the efficient deployment of both COBOL and Java applications, it can offer high-performance, resilience, and security for modernized applications in either language.”The model’s second comparative advantage is the size of its training data: 1.6 trillion tokens of code compared to less than 1 trillion tokens for most code-only models on the market. The more code tokens a model ingests, the better it typically performs on a variety of coding tasks.The model’s third advantage is the length of its context window, which is the number of tokens that can be squeezed into the user’s prompt. The model’s 32,000-token context window allows it to better capture the complexities of both applications.Modernizing software stacks with AIThe watsonx Code Assistant solution for Z is IBM’s latest effort to modernize code with the help of foundation models, AI models pre-trained on datasets the size of the internet that can be redeployed for many tasks.In 2021, IBM Research launched Project CodeNet, a dataset aimed at teaching AI systems how to program, which was cited as a source for Deep Mind’s AlphaCode project.  Project CodeNet was followed by Project Wisdom for Red Hat Ansible, an effort to use code-writing AI models to build IT automations in plain English.This work also underlies watsonx Code Assistant for Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed, an AI service that streamlines Ansible code-writing to help enterprises accelerate IT automation across the business. The solution is currently in tech preview.So far, IBM Consulting has cut the time it takes to generate Ansible playbooks for automating IT workflows by 30%.",

    "content": "Over the last several decades, software has been woven into the fabric of every aspect of our society. But for all the increased productivity that modern software has brought to how we work, the actual act of writing, testing, debugging, and shipping reliable software is still an arduous task. Even the most skilled developer needs to search for tips and shortcuts, code languages are constantly being updated, and new languages are released nearly every day.  This is why IBM Research first started exploring whether AI could make it easier to develop and deploy code. In 2021, we unveiled CodeNet, a massive, high-quality dataset with 500 million lines of code in over 50 programming languages, as well as code snippets, code problems and descriptions. We saw the value that could be unlocked in building a dataset that could train future AI agents — the ones that we envisioned would translate code from legacy languages to those that power enterprise today. Others, we saw, would teach developers how to fix issues in their code, or even write code from basic instructions written in plain English.Large language models (LLMs) trained on code are revolutionizing the software development process. Increasingly, code LLMs are being integrated into software development environments to improve the productivity of human programmers, and LLM-based agents showing promise in handling complex tasks autonomously. Realizing the full potential of code LLMs requires a wide range of capabilities, including code generation, fixing bugs, explaining and documenting code, maintaining repositories, and more.  The tremendous potential with LLMs that emerged over the last few years fueled our desire to turn our vision into a reality. And that’s exactly what we’ve begun to do with the IBM watsonx Code Assistant (WCA) family of products, like WCA for Ansible Lightspeed for IT Automation, and WCA for IBM Z for application modernization. WCA for Z uses a combination of automated tooling and IBM’s own 20-billion parameter Granite large language code model which enterprises can use to transform monolithic COBOL applications into services optimized for IBM Z. We’ve striven to find ways to make developers more productive, spending less of their time figuring out why their code won’t run, or how to get a legacy codebase to communicate to newer applications. And that’s why today we’re announcing that we’re open-sourcing four variations of the IBM Granite code model.  What we’re open sourcingWe’re releasing a series of decoder-only Granite code models for code generative tasks, trained with code written in 116 programming languages. The Granite code models family consists of models ranging in size from 3 to 34 billion parameters, in both a base model and instruction-following model variants. These models have a range of uses, from complex application modernization tasks to on-device memory-constrained use cases.  Comparing the Granite-8B-Code (Base/Instruct) with other similarly sized open-source code LLMs on HumanEvalPack. Three coding tasks and six programming languages were used.Evaluation on a comprehensive set of tasks has shown that these Granite code models consistently match state-of-the-art performance among open-source code LLMs currently available. The versatile model family was optimized for enterprise software development workflows and performs well across a range of coding tasks, including code generation, fixing, and explanation. These models are available on Hugging Face, GitHub, watsonx.ai, and RHEL AI, Red Hat’s new foundation model platform for developing, testing, and deploying generative AI models. The underlying base code models are the same as the one used to train WCA for specialized domains.  All the models were trained on data that was collected in adherence with IBM’s AI ethics principles and with the IBM legal team’s guidance for trustworthy enterprise use. These Granite Code models are released today under the Apache 2.0 license. We’re also releasing Granite Code Instruct models. This is the instruction methodology we used on the models to fine-tune, using a combination of Git commits paired with human instructions and open-source synthetically generated code instruction datasets.  Why we’re open sourcing the Granite code models  We believe in the power of open innovation, and to get to a future where writing code is as easy as talking to an always-on assistant, we want to reach as many developers as possible. No effective system is ever created by a single individual — the best work builds on the collective knowledge of those who have come before.  While the general popularity of generative AI models has skyrocketed in recent years, enterprise adoption has been slower — for good reason. In the wider world of LLM research and deployment, the major models have now grown to tens of billions of parameters, many with 70 billion or more. While that’s useful for organizations looking to build generalized chatbots that understand a wide range of subjects, these models are computationally expensive to train and run. For enterprises, massive models can become unwieldy for more specific tasks, full of irrelevant information and running up high inferencing costs.  Many enterprises have been reluctant to adopt LLMs for commercial purposes for several reasons beyond just the cost. The licensing of these models is often unclear, and how these models were trained, and how the data was cleaned and filtered for things like hate, abuse, and profanity are often unknown.  \"We are transforming the generative AI landscape for software by releasing the highest performing, cost-efficient code LLMs, truly empowering the open community to innovate on top for many use cases, without any restrictions — for research, commercial use cases, and beyond,\" said Ruchir Puri, chief scientist at IBM Research, who leads IBM’s efforts to bring coding assistants to the world. \"I am very excited about the future of software with generative AI.\"Puri believes that for many enterprise use cases, the 8B Granite code model variant we’ve released will be the right combination of weight, cost to run, and capability. But we’re also offering lighter and weightier versions that anyone in the open-source community can try out and see if they better fit their needs.  What the Granite code models enableFor many developers, writing code is not actually what takes up most of their time. Instead, it’s testing what they’ve written, ensuring it runs as intended, and finding and fixing any bugs that arise. Right now, a developer’s workflow might see them constantly jumping between whatever code they’re working on, and various online forums to figure out answers to their issues. It’s syncopated and often time-consuming.  With tools built on the IBM Granite code models, we envision a myriad of enterprise use cases for developers. That could range from agents that could write code for developers, tools that can explain why code isn’t working, and how to fix it. Many of the other quotidian but essential tasks that are part of a developer’s day — from generating unit tests, to writing documentation or running vulnerability tests — could be automated with these models.  And we see value in using these models to modernize mission-critical applications that need to remain secure, resilient, and most importantly, online. With generative systems built on Granite models, developers can create new ways to translate legacy codebases like COBOL into more modern languages like Java. It’s one of the major uses for code models that IBM saw when first diving into the world of AI for code, and remains one of the most important.  Doubling down on parametersFor the 34B version of the model, we used a novel method called depth upscaling to train the model. First, we created a duplicated version of the 20B variant, which has 52 layers to it. We removed the final eight layers from the first version of the 20B, and the first eight from the second version. We then merged the two versions to create a new model with 88 layers. We used the same 8,192 token context window when pre-training both the 20B and 34B model.An overview of depth upscaling for training the Granite-34B-Code model.How the models performIn testing against a range of other models, including those that have been opened under Apache 2.0 licenses, and more proprietary models, we found our models able to compete at a range of tasks. Testing on benchmarks including HumanEvalPack, HumanEvalPlus, and RepoBench, we saw strong performances on code synthesis, fixing, explanation, editing, and translation, across most major programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, C++, and Rust. How Granite-8B-Code-Instruct performs, compared with Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, Gemma-7B-IT, and Llama-3-8B-Instruct, on HumanEvalPack.Our models can outperform some twice their size, such as with Code Llama, and while some other models may perform slightly better in some tasks like code generation, no one model could perform at a high level at generation, fixing, and explanation — apart from Granite.ModelMATHGSM8KSATOCWMATH+PyGSM8K+PyStarCoderBase-7B2.43.818.72.218.215.6CodeLlama-7B4.111.912.52.920.826.8StarCoder2-7B10.427.237.54.828.739.4CodeGemma-7B21.849.053.16.931.160.9Granite-8B-Code-Base21.461.962.58.835.463.1Gemma-7B24.153.375.07.327.452.9Mistral-7B-v0.212.837.253.15.825.745.6Llama-3-8B15.649.834.49.90.0*2.4Lemma-7B17.333.759.47.025.640.8* The researchers noticed that Llama-3-8B-Base tends to generate invalid programs given the same prompts as the other model, resulting in very low scores on MATH+Py and GSM8K+Py tasks.The models have a unique blend of data sources that the team believes sets them apart. They used GitHub Code Clean, StarCoderData, and other public code repositories and issues on GitHub. Combined with the robust metadata in CodeNet, which outlines code issues in plain English, they mixed the code sources, natural language documentation, and code problems in a specific way to train the models.How the Granite Code models perform on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard. Overall accuracy keeps increasing as the model size increases.Granite-8B-Code vs CodeLlama-7B on Berkley Function-Calling Leaderboard. The Granite-8B-Code model (Base and Instruct) consistently outperform CodeLlama-7B (Base/Instruct) on all three metrics.The base models were trained from scratch on between 3 and 4 trillion tokens from 116 programming languages, as well as 500 billion tokens with our carefully designed mixture of high-quality data from code and natural language, which improved the models’ ability to reason and its problem-solving skills, that are essential for code generation.  What’s nextWith the Granite code models, we’re releasing models to the community that we think stack up to just about any comparable model. We’re excited to see what will be built with these models, whether that’s new code generation tools, state-of-the-art editing software, or anything in between. And this is just one aspect of the wider Granite family of models from IBM that have been designed, incubated, and released from within IBM Research. In the coming weeks, we’ll share more about other models and modalities that we believe will help shape the future of computing in exciting new ways.",

    "content": "New solution intended to help enterprises seeking to better manage training data for generative AI systems across organizations\nNEW YORK AND ARMONK, N.Y., Jan. 11, 2024 – Casper Labs, the enterprise blockchain software and services provider, and IBM (NYSE: IBM) Consulting today announced they will work to help clients leverage blockchain to gain greater transparency and auditability in their AI systems. Together, Casper Labs and IBM Consulting plan to develop a new Casper Labs solution, designed with blockchain and built leveraging IBM watsonx.governance, that establishes an additional analytics and policy enforcement layer for governing AI training data across organizations.\nThe process of training, developing and deploying generative AI models happens across multiple organizations, from the original model creator to the end user organization. As different organizations integrate new data sets or modify the models, their outputs change accordingly, and many organizations need to be able to track and audit those changes as well as accurately diagnose and remediate issues. Blockchain can help organizations share their trusted context information via metadata in the ledger documenting that the models have changed while mitigating the risk of intellectual property crossover or unnecessary data sharing across organizational lines.\nCasper Labs’ solution is planned to be built on Casper,  a tamper-resistant and highly serialized ledger, and leverage IBM watsonx.governance and watsonx.ai to monitor and measure highly serialized input and output data for training generative AI systems across organizations. Thanks to the Casper Blockchain’s hybrid nature and permissioning system, organizations can expect to be able to better protect sensitive data stored in the solution from being accessible to external actors; they have control over who can access what data. The solution will also be built to support version control using the serialization capabilities of blockchain, so organizations can efficiently revert to previous iterations of an AI system if performance issues or biased outputs occur.\nIBM Consulting’s AI governance and technology experts will assist Casper Labs in building the solution, which Casper Labs expects to be available for clients in beta in first quarter 2024 and later available more broadly in their channels and in the IBM Cloud Marketplace.\n“An AI system’s efficacy is ultimately as good as an organization’s ability to govern it,” said Shyam Nagarajan, Global Partner, Blockchain and Responsible AI Leader at IBM Consulting. “Companies need solutions that foster trust, enhance explainability, and mitigate risk. We’re proud to bring IBM Consulting and technology to support Casper Labs in creating a new solution offering an important layer to drive transparency and risk mitigation for companies deploying AI at scale.”\nThe new solution is planned to help companies across industries, including financial services, healthcare, and retail, deploy AI responsibly at scale across their ecosystem of technology and services providers. Among other features, the solution aims to offer:\nCompliance Dashboard: A centralized dashboard for monitoring and managing AI systems as they’re applied across organizations to support their compliance processes with an organization’s ethical guidelines.\nQuality Control Toolkit: Tools for monitoring the quality and performance of AI systems, along with an interface to enhance the transparency and explainability of AI outputs.\nVersion Control: The ability to correct for performance or other issues by “rolling back” to previous iterations of a given AI system that didn’t display issues.\nAudit and Reporting System: A system for auditing AI processes and generating detailed reports based on context metadata captured by Casper Labs’ ledger.\n“While generative AI has justifiably excited organizations for its transformative potential, its practical applications have been severely limited by an inability to monitor and react to the data feeding AI systems,” said Mrinal Manohar, CEO at Casper Labs. “With IBM’s help, we’re committed to delivering a better way to not only understand why AI systems behave the way that they do but also a clearer path to remediate behavior if hallucinations or performance issues occur. AI’s long-term potential will be dictated by how effectively and efficiently organizations can understand, govern and react to increasingly massive AI training data sets.”\nCasper Labs and IBM Consulting to Demonstrate AI Governance Solution in Davos\nOn Tuesday, January 16, Mrinal Manohar and Shyam Nagarajan will preview this solution during a live session at The Hub in Davos. To register for that session, visit thehubdavos.com, or follow Casper Labs on Youtube to view the playback.\nView a webinar featuring Casper Labs and IBM demonstrating the proof of concept of the solution's technical capabilities",

Despite major technological advances, the discovery and development of therapeutic antibodies covering diverse epitopes remains a highly complex and time-consuming process.\nTogether, Boehringer and IBM researchers will aim to accelerate the antibody discovery process through in-silico methods.  The sequence, structure and molecular profile information of disease-relevant targets as well as success criteria for therapeutically relevant antibody molecules, like affinity, specificity and developability will form the basis for the in-silico generation of new human antibody sequences. These methods rely on new IBM foundation model technologies, designed to increase the speed and efficiency of antibody discovery and quality of predicted antibody candidates.\nIBM’s foundation model technologies, which have demonstrated success in generating biologics and small molecules with relevant target affinities, are used to design antibody candidates for the defined targets which are subsequently screened with AI-enhanced simulation to select and refine the best binders for the target. In a validation step, Boehringer Ingelheim will produce in mini-scales and experimentally assess the antibody candidates. Moving forward, the results from the laboratory experiments will be used to improve the in-silico methods via feedback loops.\nBy collaborating with leading academic and industry partners, Boehringer is building a leading digital ecosystem to enable the acceleration of drug discovery and development and create new breakthrough opportunities to transform patients’ lives.\nThis work also serves as the latest in IBM’s efforts to use generative AI and foundation models to accelerate discovery and creation of new biologics and small molecules. Earlier this year, the company’s generative AI model efficiently predicted physico-chemical properties of drug-like small molecules.\nThe IBM biomedical foundation model technologies rely on a wide range of heterogenous, publicly available data sets, including protein-protein interactions and drug-target interactions to develop pre-trained models.  The pre-trained models are then fine-tuned on specific proprietary data of IBM’s partner to offer newly designed proteins and small molecules with the desired properties.\nIBM is a leading provider of global hybrid cloud and AI, and consulting expertise. We help clients in more than 175 countries capitalize on insights from their data, streamline business processes, reduce costs and gain the competitive edge in their industries. More than 4,000 government and corporate entities in critical infrastructure areas such as financial services, telecommunications and healthcare rely on IBM’s hybrid cloud platform and Red Hat OpenShift to affect their digital transformations quickly, efficiently, and securely.\nIBM’s breakthrough innovations in AI, quantum computing, industry-specific cloud solutions and consulting deliver open and flexible options to our clients.

    "content": "We define eras using themes that unite periods of time. In the case of quantum computing, the theme of the past few decades has been the emergence and establishment of this new technology. The community focused on laying the groundwork: experimenting with quantum hardware, devising use cases, and educating people on how to use quantum computers, while running experiments benchmarking devices. We made quantum computing real.\nBut earlier this year, we published an experimentA new paper from IBM and UC Berkeley shows a path toward useful quantum computing. Read more. that changed the status quo. We demonstrated that quantum computers could run circuits beyond the reach of brute-force classical simulations. For the first time, we have hardware and software capable of executing quantum circuits with no known a priori answer at a scale of 100 qubits and 3,000 gates. Quantum is now a computational tool, and what makes me most excited is that we can start to advance science in fields beyond quantum computing, itself.\nI like to say users are using quantum computing to do quantum computing, and we are adding capabilities that open up quantum to an extended set of users that includes what we refer to as quantum computational scientists. We think this is proof enough that we’ve entered a new era.\nFrom these large-scale experiments, it has become clear that we must go beyond the traditional circuit model and take advantage of parallelism, concurrent classical computing, and dynamic circuits. We have ample evidence that, with tools such as circuit knitting, we can enhance the reach of quantum computation, and new quantum algorithms are emerging that make use of multiple quantum circuits, potentially in parallel and with concurrent classical operations.  It is clear that a heterogeneous computing architecture consisting of scalable and parallel circuit execution and advanced classical computation is required.\nThis is our vision for the high-performance systems for the future: quantum-centric supercomputing. At this year’s IBM Quantum Summit, we announce major updates that bring us closer to this goal, as well as an extended roadmap that details the journey toward quantum-centric supercomputing over the next decade — allowing more advanced utility-scale work and a frictionless development environment for our users.\nIBM Debuts Next-Generation Quantum Processor & IBM Quantum System Two, Extends Roadmap to Advance Era of Quantum Utility\nBreaking the 1,000-qubit barrier with Condor\nWe have introduced IBM Condor, a 1,121 superconducting qubit quantum processor based on our cross-resonance gate technology. Condor pushes the limits of scale and yield in chip design with a 50% increase in qubit density, advances in qubit fabrication and laminate size, and includes over a mile of high-density cryogenic flex IO wiring within a single dilution refrigerator. With performance comparable to our previous 433-qubit Osprey, it serves as an innovation milestone, solving scale and informing future hardware design.\nAccess to the highest performing quantum processor: Heron\nBuilding on four years of research, we introduced the first IBM Quantum Heron processor on the ibm_torino quantum system. Featuring 133 fixed-frequency qubits with tunable couplers, Heron yields a 3-5x improvement in device performance over our previous flagship 127-qubit Eagle processors, and virtually eliminates cross-talk. With Heron, we have developed a qubit and the gate technology that we’re confident will form the foundation of our hardware roadmap going forward.\nIBM Quantum Heron features 133 fixed-frequency qubits with tunable couplers, yielding a 3-5x improvement in device performance over our previous flagship 127-qubit Eagle processors, and virtually eliminates cross-talk.\nIBM Quantum System Two: The system for a decade of scalable quantum computation\nIBM Quantum System Two is the bedrock for scalable quantum computation, and is now operational at our lab in Yorktown Heights, NY. It is 22 feet wide, 12 feet high, and today features three IBM Quantum Heron processors. It combines cryogenic infrastructure with third-generation control electronics and classical runtime servers.\nIBM Quantum System Two is the modular-architecture quantum computing platform that we will use to realize parallel circuit executions for quantum-centric supercomputing.\nQiskit 1.0 coming in February 2024\nQuantum-centric supercomputing is not achieved by hardware alone. It requires performant software for generating and manipulating quantum circuits and middleware for executing hybrid quantum-classical workflows in a heterogeneous computing environment. Qiskit 1.0 marks the first stable release of Qiskit, the most popular quantum computing SDK. It delivers marked improvements in circuit construction, compilation times, and memory consumption compared to earlier releases.\nIn addition, Qiskit 1.0 outperforms competing compilation frameworks in both runtime and resultant two-qubit gate counts when mapping circuits to quantum hardware.\nAI transpilation alpha for Premium Users\nIBM brings the power of AI to quantum computing with the world’s first circuit compilation service using reinforcement learning running on the IBM Quantum Platform. This initial preview demonstrates a reduction in two-qubit gate count of 20-50% compared to standard heuristic methods.\nTo further optimize throughput when executing multiple independent jobs, we introduce batch mode — a new execution mode yielding up to a 5x improvement in execution time relative to single-job submission. In addition, for utility-scale iterative workloads we have released extended Sessions, which allow for combining multiple Sessions together to seamlessly enable advanced quantum-classical workloads.\nQiskit Patterns and Quantum Serverless\nIBM introduced Qiskit Patterns, a programming template outlining the structure of quantum programs and a logical framework for building quantum algorithms and applications at scale. Taking advantage of the composability, containerization, and abstraction provided by Qiskit Patterns, users can seamlessly create quantum algorithms and applications from a collection of foundational building blocks and execute those Patterns using heterogeneous computing infrastructure such as Quantum Serverless. This allows for targeted quantum acceleration of preexisting enterprise scale workflows and provides for abstraction away from quantum circuits and operators. With Qiskit Patterns, IBM is announcing the deployment of Quantum Serverless as beta for managed, unattended execution of Patterns at scale.\nGenerative AI for quantum on watsonx\nTo better streamline the quantum development process, IBM is pioneering the use of generative AI for quantum code programming through watsonx, the enterprise AI platform from IBM. We demonstrate how generative AI available through watsonx can help automate the development of quantum code for Qiskit. We achieve this through the fine-tuning of the IBM Granite 20-billion parameter code foundation model.\nIn order to guide our mission to realize quantum-centric supercomputing, we are expanding our industry-defining roadmap out to 2033 for a decade worth of quantum innovation. The roadmap highlights improvements in the number of gates that our processors and systems will be able to execute. Starting with a target of Heron reaching 5,000 gates in 2024, the roadmap lays out multiple generations of processors, each leveraging improvements in quality to achieve ever-larger gate counts.\nThen, in 2029, we hit an inflection point: executing 100 million gates over 200 qubits with our Starling processor employing error correction based on the novel Gross code. This is followed by Blue Jay, a system capable of executing 1 billion gates across 2,000 qubits by 2033. This represents a nine order-of-magnitude increase in performed gates since we put our first device on the cloud in 2016. Our new innovation roadmap will demonstrate the technology needed to realize the Gross code through l-, m-, and c-couplers to be demonstrated by Flamingo, Crossbill, and Kookaburra processors, respectively.\nLaying the groundwork for quantum-powered use cases\nUniversity of Tokyo, Argonne National Laboratory, Fundacion Ikerbasque, Qedma, Algorithmiq, University of Washington, University of Cologne, Harvard University, UC Berkeley, Q-CTRL all demonstrated new research to explore the power of utility-scale quantum computing. These demonstrations showed that advances in both device quality and new capabilities are allowing us to explore more challenging circuits, extending beyond quantum computing native problems to use quantum and classical working together to extend the reach of the systems.\nUpdating our offerings for the era of utility\nEntering the era of utility opens up new opportunities for enterprises to engage with quantum computing and explore workforce integration. We are expanding our enterprise offerings to continue to advance industry use cases for utility-scale quantum computing.\nThis progress in quantum technology also means that to keep our data secure, we need new cryptography based on mathematical problems that are challenging to both quantum and classical computers. IBM Quantum Safe helps enterprises assess their cryptographic posture and modernize their cybersecurity landscape for the era of quantum utility.\nOur updated IBM Quantum Safe roadmap highlights how we are continuing to advance research into quantum-safe cryptography, foster industry partnerships to drive adoption of post-quantum cryptographic solutions, and develop new quantum-safe technologies — including IBM Quantum Safe Explorer, our cryptographic discovery tool released this past October.",

Credit: HLS/NASA IMPACT.\nA public/private partnership involving NASA and IBM Research has led to the release of NASA's first open-source geospatial artificial intelligence (AI) foundation model for Earth observation data. Built using NASA's Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) dataset, the release of the HLS Geospatial Foundation Model (HLS Geospatial FM) is a milestone in the application of AI for Earth science. The model has a wide range of potential applications, including tracking changes in land use, monitoring natural disasters, and predicting crop yields. The HLS Geospatial FM is available at Hugging Face(link is external), a public repository for open-source machine learning models.\nNASA's Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team (IMPACT) played a major role in this work. Located at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, IMPACT is a component of NASA's Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) Program and is charged with expanding the use of NASA Earth observation data through innovation, partnerships, and technology, including the application of AI to these data.\n\"AI foundation models for Earth observations present enormous potential to address intricate scientific problems and expedite the broader deployment of AI across diverse applications,” says Dr. Rahul Ramachandran, IMPACT manager and a senior research scientist at Marshall. “We call on the Earth science and applications communities to evaluate this initial HLS foundation model for a variety of uses and share feedback on its merits and drawbacks.\"\nAlong with NASA and IBM Research, this collaborative effort included Clark University's Center for Geospatial Analytics, ESA (European Space Agency), USGS, and the U.S. Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This work is part of NASA's Open-Source Science Initiative (OSSI), a commitment to building an inclusive, transparent, and collaborative open science community over the next decade. Development of the HLS Geospatial FM began in January 2023, and the FM was released in July 2023.\nThe Significance of Foundation Models\nFoundation models(link is external) (FMs) are types of AI models trained on a broad set of unlabeled data. They can be used for different tasks and can apply information about one situation to another. The goal of the NASA/IBM work is to provide an easier way for researchers to analyze and draw insights from large NASA datasets related to Earth processes.\n\"We believe that foundation models have the potential to change the way observational data are analyzed and help us to better understand our planet,\" says NASA Chief Science Data Officer Kevin Murphy. \"And by open-sourcing such models and making them available to the world, we hope to multiply their impact.\"\nAI FMs have the potential to play a pivotal role in understanding our planet's interconnected processes and the climate effects of ongoing natural and human-caused changes. FMs that are pretrained on Earth observation data can accelerate the analysis of tremendous amounts of data in two primary ways.\nFirst, FMs do not need large training datasets, which can be laborious and resource-intensive to create. The ability to train FMs on much smaller datasets can save time and money. Second, FMs can reduce redundant efforts to build downstream applications, which use FM output to perform a specific task, such as tracking changes in land use or monitoring natural disasters.\nThe Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 Data Collection\nTrue-color HLS image of northwest Iceland acquired on July 11, 2023. NASA IMPACT developed the processing stream to expand HLS coverage from 28% of Earth to near-global. Interactively explore this image in NASA Worldview. Credit: HLS/NASA IMPACT; NASA Worldview.\nHLS is a logical dataset on which to base the FM work. The HLS project provides consistent surface reflectance data from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard the joint NASA/USGS Landsat 8 and 9 satellites and the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard the European Union's Copernicus Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B satellites. The combined sensor measurements enable global land observations every 2 to 3 days at 30-meter spatial resolution.\nNASA IMPACT was instrumental in developing the HLS processing architecture to achieve near-global coverage. HLS imagery can be interactively explored using the NASA Worldview Earth science data visualization tool and can be downloaded through NASA Earthdata Search.\nThe Road to the HLS Geospatial FM\nThe infrastructure needed for AI FMs is constantly evolving as the neural network architectures used to train these models become more complex. FMs are typically trained on massive datasets, which requires a significant amount of computing power.\nAs part of the NASA/IBM collaboration, IBM Research trained the HLS Geospatial FM on the IBM Cloud Vela supercomputer using the IBM watsonx FM stack, which is a cloud-based platform for training and deploying FMs. The IBM watsonx FM stack is currently running in NASA's Science Managed Cloud Environment (SMCE). Located at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, the SMCE is designed to accelerate NASA science research by enabling quick access to cloud resources for rapid prototyping and open collaboration.\nNASA, IBM Research, and Clark University teams are in the process of assessing the HLS Geospatial FM for a wide range of downstream applications, including classification, object detection, time-series segmentation, and similarity search. The FM already has been applied to flood mapping, where it achieved state-of-the-art performance using smaller samples. Along with flood mapping, the FM also has been applied to burn scar identification, a critical component for active fire management and post-fire recovery. Additionally, using time-series data, the teams have shown the benefits of using the FM model for land cover and crop type mapping in diverse geographies across the contiguous United States.\nA recent workshop demonstrated the potential of AI FMs for Earth science applications. Organized by IMPACT in collaboration with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (IEEE GRSS) Earth Science Informatics Technical Committee (ESI TC), the workshop covered the development of FMs using HLS data and included a hands-on exercise in fine-tuning the FM using IBM's watsonx.ai. Participants also applied the model to new HLS data and successfully fine-tuned the FM for flood water detection and burn scar identification.\nThe workshop demonstrated that with the right tutorials, platform, and infrastructure, it is possible to quickly train geoscientists to effectively use FMs for downstream applications. This is a significant step forward in the development of AI for Earth science, as it opens up the possibility of using FMs to solve a wide range of problems.\nAlong with the work on the HLS Geospatial FM, NASA and IBM are developing other applications to extract insights from Earth observations, including a large language model based on Earth science literature. In keeping with NASA's open science guidelines and principles, models and products resulting from this collaborative work will be open and available to the entire science community.\nHugging Face calls the HLS Geospatial FM family pipelines Prithvi. Prithvi is a first-of-its-kind temporal vision transformer pre-trained by the NASA and IBM team on contiguous U.S. HLS data.\nPrithvi 100M model(link is external)\nPrithvi 100M demo(link is external)\nPrithvi 100M Burn Scars model(link is external)\nPrithvi 100M Burn Scars demo(link is external)\nPrithvi 100M Flooding model(link is external)\nPrithvi 100M Flooding demo(link is external)\nPrithvi 100M Multitemporal Crop Detection:\nPrithvi 100M Multitemporal Crop Detection model(link is external)\nPrithvi 100M Multitemporal Crop Detection demo(link is external)",

    "content": "A collaboration involving NASA and IBM Research has led to the development of a new artificial intelligence (AI) foundation model for weather and climate: Prithvi-weather-climate (Prithvi is the Sanskrit name for Earth). The model is pre-trained on 40 years of weather and climate data from NASA's Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2), and fills a need to infuse AI and machine learning (ML) methods into weather and climate applications, such as storm tracking, forecasting, and historical analysis.\nIn keeping with NASA's open science policies, Prithvi-weather-climate will be openly available. The model and the code will be released later in 2024 through Hugging Face(link is external), a public repository for open-source ML models.\nGlobal MERRA-2 atmospheric temperature at 650 hPa (approximately 11,500 feet) on July 12, 2016. Red/dark red colors indicate higher atmospheric temperatures; blue/purple colors indicate lower temperatures. Credit: NASA GMAO.\nThe Role of Foundation Models\nUsing AI to sift through data to find solutions requires not only massive amounts of data, but also large amounts of time. As noted by IBM Research, the next stage in AI model development(link is external) is to create models pre-trained on a broad set of unlabeled data that can be used as the foundation for different tasks that require minimal fine-tuning. These are called foundation models, or FMs.\nFMs are the basis for enabling AI and ML systems to ingest large amounts of data and generate results based on associations among the data. They serve as a baseline from which scientists can develop a diverse set of applications that can result in powerful and efficient solutions. Once an FM is created, it can be trained on a small amount of data to perform a specific task.\nBut creating and pre-training FMs still requires lots of data. When it comes to addressing the need for massive amounts openly available Earth science data, NASA's Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) Program is a logical source. The more than 100 petabytes (PB) of data the program distributes openly and without restriction is the secret sauce that helps make open-source Earth science-based FM development possible. This combination of open NASA Earth science data and IBM Research's state-of-the-art computational power led to the groundbreaking work using NASA Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) data to create the Prithvi Geospatial FM, the first open-source geospatial FM, in 2023. Prithvi-weather-climate builds on this achievement.\n\"Foundation models offer amazing prospects for expanding the use of NASA’s vast archive of Earth observations,\" says NASA Earth Data Officer Katie Baynes. \"The Prithvi-weather-climate model holds promise to advance our understanding of atmospheric dynamics and developing new applications. We're excited to see how the community can leverage this work to enhance resilience to climate and weather-related hazards.\"\nParticipants at the Prithvi-weather-climate workshop at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, which took place September 20 and 21, 2023. The diverse team included experts from NASA, IBM Research, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, NVIDIA Corporation, and universities engaged in AI research and development. Image: Dr. Rahul Ramachandran/NASA IMPACT.\nWork on Prithvi-weather-climate began in September 2023 with a workshop at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, AL. Marshall is the home of NASA's Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team (IMPACT), a NASA ESDS element charged with expanding the use of NASA Earth observation data through innovation, partnerships, and technology—including the application of AI to these data.\n\"This model is part of our overall strategy to openly and collaboratively develop a family of AI foundation models to support NASA's science mission goals,\" says IMPACT Manager Dr. Rahul Ramachandran. \"These models will augment our capabilities to draw insights from our vast archives of Earth observations.\"\nJoining the IMPACT and IBM Research teams in developing Prithvi-weather-climate were participants from NASA Headquarters, NASA's Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO), NASA's Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS), the NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) Facility, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), and NVIDIA Corporation. Several universities engaged in various aspects of AI or large-scale computing and weather/climate science participated as well, including the University of Alabama in Huntsville, Colorado State University, and Stanford University.\nThe focus of the Marshall workshop was to plan the next six to eight months of work necessary to develop and pre-train the model. It was decided that the FM would contain parameters such as wind speed and direction, air temperature, specific humidity, cloud mass variables, and longwave and shortwave radiation variables. To be valuable to the broader science community, the team agreed that the focus should not be on forecasting; rather, the FM should enable many different types of downstream science applications.\nMERRA-2 aerosol optical depth (AOD) for July 21, 2012, when a massive dust storm was moving off the northwest coast of Africa. White and yellow colors indicate lower AOD values and a cleaner atmosphere; purples and reds indicate higher AOD values and higher concentrations of atmospheric aerosols. Credit: NASA GMAO.\nThe foundation of Prithvi-weather-climate is 40 years of MERRA-2 data. MERRA-2 is the first long-term global reanalysis to assimilate space-based observations of aerosols and represent their interactions with other physical processes in the climate system. These data are available through NASA's Earthdata Search. MERRA-2 was created by NASA's GMAO to replace and enhance the original MERRA and to sustain GMAO's commitment to having an ongoing near real-time climate analysis.\n\"With the Prithvi-weather-climate FM, NASA and IBM have led the creation of a unique AI representation of all knowledge available in 40 years' worth of MERRA-2 data,\" says Dr. Juan Bernabé-Moreno, director of IBM Research Europe and IBM’s accelerated discovery lead for climate and sustainability. \"The IBM-NASA collaboration highlights how open-source technologies are essential to advancing crucial research into areas such as climate change. By merging IBM's foundation model technology with NASA's deep expertise and specialized climate datasets, we've developed flexible, reusable AI systems for broader use.\"\nApplications to Science and Society\nThe Prithvi-weather-climate FM has broad applications for both science and society.\nFrom a scientific and research standpoint, the model has been fine-tuned to increase the resolution of long-term climate models by a factor of 12x, a process known as \"downscaling.\" Using an AI model in this context avoids the high costs associated with the conventional approach using high performance computing (HPC). The FM also improves the use of AI for better representation of small-scale physical processes in numerical weather and climate models. Through the insertion of tokens in the model at wind turbine locations, Prithvi-weather-climate can generate targeted forecasts using hyper-localized, asset-specific observations, further improving the accuracy of short to medium-range forecasts.\nThe application of AI to weather and climate data also can lead to improvements in public safety. Uses being developed by the research team for Prithvi-weather-climate include more precise hurricane track and intensity forecasts along with better seasonal precipitation forecasting. As the model continues to be trained, future applications include the detection and prediction of severe weather patterns, more detailed wildfire behavior forecasts, finer turbulence detection and prediction, urban heatwave prediction, and improved solar radiation assessment.\n\"Our ambition is to accelerate and advance the impact of NASA's Earth science to meet this moment of changing climate for the benefit of all humankind,\" says Dr. Karen St. Germain, director of NASA's Earth Science Division. \"The [NASA/IBM Research] foundation model for weather and climate will enable this Earth Science to Action strategy.\"\nAlong with the participants noted in the Creating Prithvi-weather-climate section, the development of the FM was accomplished by a diverse team with deep experience representing varied aspects of AI and ML.\nModel Development: NASA, University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH), and ORNL\nDr. Arlindo da Silva, NASA GMAO\nDr. Arlindo da Silva, NASA GMAO\nDr. Simon Pfreundschuh, Colorado State University\nDr. Aman Gupta, Stanford University\nMike Little, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center\nDr. Mark Carroll, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center\nShubha Ranjan, NASA's Ames Research Center, NAS\nBill Thigpen, NASA's Ames Research Center, NAS\nDr. Rahul Ramachandran, NASA IMPACT\nDr. Manil Maskey, NASA IMPACT\nDr. Tsengdar Lee, NASA Headquarters\nBuilding an AI Foundation Model for Weather and Climate\nNASA, IBM Research Release New AI Foundation Model for Weather, Climate Forecasts\nIBM and NASA are building an AI foundation model for weather and climate(link is external)\nBlog: Environmental analysis made easier with IBM’s Geospatial Studio(link is external)\nMukkavilli, S.K., et al.

    "content": "Extreme heat has gripped many parts of the world this summer, increasing the risk of wildfires and drought. Mapping the aftermath of these events can help communities predict which areas are most at risk in the future and plan where to focus their adaptation efforts.Climate change poses numerous risks. The need to understand quickly and clearly how Earth’s landscape is changing is one reason IBM set out six months ago in a collaboration with NASA to build an AI model that could speed up the analysis of satellite images and boost scientific discovery. Another motivator was the desire to make nearly 250,000 terabytes of NASA mission data accessible to more people.To further both goals, IBM is now making its foundation model public through the open-source AI platform, Hugging Face. It’s the largest geospatial model to be hosted on Hugging Face and the first open-source AI foundation model NASA has collaborated to build. And, it can analyze geospatial data up to four times faster than state-of-the-art deep-learning models, with half as much labeled data, IBM has estimated.“AI remains a science-driven field, and science can only progress through information sharing and collaboration,” said Jeff Boudier, head of product and growth at Hugging Face. “This is why open-source AI and the open release of models and datasets are so fundamental to the continued progress of AI, and making sure the technology will benefit as many people as possible.”IBM fine-tuned the model to allow users to map the extent of past U.S. floods and wildfires, measurements that can be used to predict future areas of risk. But with additional fine tuning, the model could be redeployed for tasks like tracking deforestation, predicting crop yields, or detecting and monitoring greenhouse gasses.Foundation models are highly versatile, and by open sourcing this one, Hugging Face, NASA, and IBM hope that researchers worldwide will be motivated to improve on it and build other geospatial models and applications. IBM and NASA researchers are currently working with Clark University to adapt the model for other applications, including time-series segmentation and similarity search.\"AI foundation models for Earth observations present enormous potential to address intricate scientific problems and expedite the broader deployment of AI across diverse applications,” says Rahul Ramachandran, IMPACT Manager and a senior research scientist at Marshall. “We call on the Earth science and applications communities to evaluate this initial HLS foundation model for a variety of uses and share feedback.”Turning pixels into insightsUnderpinning all foundation models is the transformer, an AI architecture that can turn heaps of raw data — text, audio, or in this case, satellite images — into a compressed representation that captures the data’s basic structure. From this scaffold of knowledge, a foundation model can be tailored to a wide variety of tasks with some extra labeled data and tuning.Traditionally, analyzing satellite data has been highly tedious because of the time required for human experts to annotate features like crops and trees in each satellite image. Foundation models cut out a lot of this manual effort by extracting the structure of raw, natural images so that fewer labeled examples are needed. In January, under a NASA Space Act Agreement, IBM began training a foundation model on a sliver of NASA’s Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2  (HLS) dataset, which provides a full view of Earth every two to three days. At a resolution of 30-meters per pixel, HLS images are close enough for detecting changes in land-use but not quite detailed enough for identifying individual trees.Built on a vision transformer and a masked autoencoder architecture, the model has been adapted to process satellite images by expanding its spatial attention mechanism to include time. IBM trained the model on its AI supercomputer,  Vela, and leveraged PyTorch and ecosystem libraries for training and tuning on labeled images of floods and burn-scars from wildfires. In tests, researchers saw a 15% accuracy boost compared to state-of-the-art deep learning models for mapping  floods and  fires.The project coincides with NASA’s Year of Open Science, a series of events to promote data and AI model sharing. It’s also part of NASA’s decade-long Open-Source Science Initiative to build a more accessible, inclusive, and collaborative scientific community.IBM’s decision to open source the model follows a long commitment to making AI accessible to everyone, from its support of Red Hat OpenShift to enable portable cloud computing, to its work with the Ray and PyTorch communities to coordinate and streamline AI workflows.",

    "content": ",  /PRNewswire/ -- Today IBM (NYSE: IBM) launched watsonx Code Assistant, a generative AI-powered assistant that helps enterprise developers and IT operators code more quickly and more accurately using natural language prompts. The product currently delivers on two specific enterprise use cases. First, IT Automation with watsonx Code Assistant for Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed, for tasks such as network configuration and code deployment. Second, mainframe application modernization with watsonx Code Assistant for Z, for translation of COBOL to Java.1\nDesigned to accelerate development while maintaining the principles of trust, security, and compliance, the product leverages generative AI based on IBM's Granite foundation models for code running on IBM's watsonx platform. Granite uses the decoder architecture, which underpins large language model capabilities to predict what is next in a sequence to support natural language processing tasks. IBM is exploring opportunities to tune watsonx Code Assistant with additional domain-specific generative AI capabilities to assist in code generation, code explanation, and the full end-to-end software development lifecycle to continue to drive enterprise application modernization.\nAccording to a recent IDC report, \"Because it relies on a model trained on curated data, watsonx Code Assistant can help enterprises improve code quality by propagating best practices through code recommendations, instead of polluting enterprise code bases with code generated by models trained on unvetted repositories.\"2\n\"With this launch, watsonx Code Assistant joins watsonx Orchestrate and watsonx Assistant in IBM's growing line of watsonx assistants that provide enterprises with tangible ways to implement generative AI,\" said Kareem Yusuf, Ph.D, Senior Vice President, Product Management and Growth, IBM Software. \"Watsonx Code Assistant puts AI-assisted code development and application modernization tools directly into the hands of developers – in a naturally integrated way that is designed to be non-disruptive – to help address skills gaps and increase productivity.\"\nAdditionally, IBM Consulting brings deep domain expertise across these use cases working closely with clients across industries such as banking, insurance, healthcare and government, to build strategies to allow them to take advantage of the potential of generative AI and code generation to accelerate modernization.\nIT Automation - IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed\nThe Ansible Automation Platform helps enterprise developers and IT operators implement automation, using Ansible Playbooks, for IT tasks including infrastructure management, hybrid cloud deployment, network configuration, application deployment and more. With IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed, platform users can input plain English prompts to automatically generate task recommendations for Ansible Playbooks that adhere to best practices in task creation and maintenance. This way, a greater number of team members can create Ansible Playbooks more efficiently and implement automation engineered to be more resilient and easier to support without in-depth training.\nApproximately 4,000 developers participated in the technical preview.\n85% overall average acceptance rate of the AI-generated content recommendations.

    "content": "The next time the city makes public school students have a remote learning day, the Department of Education may be forced to assign different login times — complicating an already difficult process.\n“If we have a remote learning day tomorrow, we should be working to stagger start times, which we agree is not ideal from a student and staff perspective but it’s pretty important to us that we get it right if we need to transition tomorrow,” Emma Vadehra, the DOE's chief operating officer and deputy chancellor, said at a City Council hearing.\nWhat You Need To Know\nAn executive with IBM, the tech giant and vendor to the city Department of Education, said its technology was not to blame for the failure of students to login to remote learning system during last month's snow storm\nEducation officials said they may consider staggering log in times for future remote learning days\nEducation officials said the city may need to change its contract with IBM to allow the tech company to automatically scale up its ability to handle login attempts on remote learning days\nThat’s a lesson the Adams administration learned the hard way, after many students and parents were unable to log into the DOE's remote learning system on the morning of Feb. 13, when the city closed schools for a snowstorm.\nAt the time, Mayor Eric Adams and schools leadership blamed the tech vendor, IBM, for the login meltdown. But at a City Council hearing Wednesday, a top IBM top executive for New York defended the tech giant’s performance.\n“It was not a failure of IBM technology,” Vanessa Hunt, the IBM executive, said.\nHunt also described DOE’s notice on Feb. 12 ahead of the remote learning day, saying, “The notification said we may have a fully remote day” and “can you please keep an eye” on the level of login attempts.\nHunt added that if DOE and IBM officials communicated at a higher level than just technical staff, the outcome may have been different.\n“I think DOE and IBM agree on this. I think ideally, we would have been planning way before the day before, I think we would have been part of the simulations, part of the planning and we would have been better advising the DOE on potentially staggering start times,” Hunt said.\nThe hearing focused on the city’s contract with IBM, inked before the pandemic and characterized as outdated and insufficient to handle a school system with roughly a million children.\nLawmakers focused on the contract terms that offer the ability to handle hundreds of login attempts a second — referred to as transactions, not the thousands per second needed for a school system the size of New York’s.\n“Why is it the case that you were still using transactions that are similar to the numbers in 2018 and have not updated those numbers and the services you’re procuring?” asked Councilman Eric Dinowitz of the Bronx.\n“I think that’s a fair question, as we indicated this year and especially during a peak period, we need much more capacity than that to be successful,” Scott Strickland, the acting DOE chief information officer on Feb. 13, said.\nCouncilmembers zeroed in on the DOE not involving IBM in testing its own service.\n“Sorry, but why were they not involved, given that they manage the whole system?” asked Councilman Shekar Krishnan of Queens.\n“The objective of that test was to make sure our students and staff were prepared and could do the work and we had not experienced difficulties, again, across the pandemic with any of our major vendors that provide these services,” Strickland responded.\nEducation officials said the city’s contract with IBM should change. For example, by creating a system that would allow IBM to automatically scale up the capacity to handle logins for remote learning as needed.\nCouncil education chair Rita Joseph said she believes such a system would allow schools to handle a citywide remote learning day.",

(NASDAQ: HCP), a leading multi-cloud infrastructure automation company, today announced they have entered into a definitive agreement under which IBM will acquire HashiCorp for $35 per share in cash, representing an enterprise value of $6.4 billion. HashiCorp's suite of products provides enterprises with extensive Infrastructure Lifecycle Management and Security Lifecycle Management capabilities to enable organizations to automate their hybrid and multi-cloud environments. Today's announcement is a continuation of IBM's deep focus and investment in hybrid cloud and AI, the two most transformational technologies for clients today.\n\"Enterprise clients are wrestling with an unprecedented expansion in infrastructure and applications across public and private clouds, as well as on-prem environments. The global excitement surrounding generative AI has exacerbated these challenges and CIOs and developers are up against dramatic complexity in their tech strategies,\" said Arvind Krishna, IBM chairman and chief executive officer. \"HashiCorp has a proven track record of enabling clients to manage the complexity of today's infrastructure and application sprawl. Combining IBM's portfolio and expertise with HashiCorp's capabilities and talent will create a comprehensive hybrid cloud platform designed for the AI era.\"\nThe rise of cloud-native workloads and associated applications is driving a radical expansion in the number of cloud workloads enterprises are managing. In addition, generative AI deployment continues to grow alongside traditional workloads. As a result, developers are working with increasingly heterogeneous, dynamic, and complex infrastructure strategies. This represents a massive challenge for technology professionals.\nHashiCorp's capabilities enable enterprises to use automation to deliver lifecycle management for infrastructure and security, providing a system of record for the critical workflows needed for hybrid and multi-cloud environments. HashiCorp's Terraform is the industry standard for infrastructure provisioning in these environments. HashiCorp's offerings help clients take a cloud-agnostic, and highly interoperable approach to multi-cloud management, and complement IBM's commitment to industry collaboration (including deep and expanding partnerships with hyperscale cloud service providers), developer communities, and open-source hybrid cloud and AI innovation.\n\"Our strategy at its core is about enabling companies to innovate in the cloud, while providing a consistent approach to managing cloud at scale. The need for effective management and automation is critical with the rise of multi-cloud and hybrid cloud, which is being accelerated by today's AI revolution,\" said Armon Dadgar, HashiCorp co-founder and chief technology officer. \"I'm incredibly excited by today's news and to be joining IBM to accelerate HashiCorp's mission and expand access to our products to an even broader set of developers and enterprises.\"\n\"Today is an exciting day for our dedicated teams across the world as well as the developer communities we serve,\" said Dave McJannet, HashiCorp chief executive officer. \"IBM's leadership in hybrid cloud along with its rich history of innovation, make it the ideal home for HashiCorp as we enter the next phase of our growth journey. I'm proud of the work we've done as a standalone company, I am excited to be able to help our customers further, and I look forward to the future of HashiCorp as part of IBM.\"\nStrong Strategic Fit – The acquisition of HashiCorp by IBM creates a comprehensive end-to-end hybrid cloud platform built for AI-driven complexity. The combination of each company's portfolio and talent will deliver clients extensive application, infrastructure and security lifecycle management capabilities\nAccelerates growth in key focus areas – Upon close, HashiCorp is expected to drive significant synergies for IBM, including across multiple strategic growth areas like Red Hat, watsonx, data security, IT automation and Consulting. For example, the powerful combination of Red Hat's Ansible Automation Platform's configuration management and Terraform's automation will simplify provisioning and configuration of applications across hybrid cloud environments. The two companies also anticipate an acceleration of HashiCorp's growth initiatives by leveraging IBM's world-class go-to-market strategy, scale, and reach, operating in more than 175 countries across the globe\nExpands Total Addressable Market (TAM) – The acquisition will create the opportunity to deliver more comprehensive hybrid and multi-cloud offerings to enterprise clients. HashiCorp's offerings, combined with IBM and Red Hat, will give clients a platform to automate the deployment and orchestration of workloads across evolving infrastructure including hyperscale cloud service providers, private clouds and on-prem environments. This will enhance IBM's ability to address the total cloud opportunity, which according to IDC had a TAM of $1.1 trillion in 2023, with a compound annual growth rate in the high teens through 2027.1\nAttractive Financial Opportunity – The transaction will accelerate IBM's growth profile over time driven by go-to-market and product synergies. This growth combined with operating efficiencies, is expected to achieve substantial near-term margin expansion for the acquired business. It is anticipated that the transaction will be accretive to Adjusted EBITDA within the first full year, post close, and free cash flow in year two.\nHashiCorp boasts a roster of more than 4,400 clients, including Bloomberg, Comcast, Deutsche Bank, GitHub, J.P Morgan Chase, Starbucks and Vodafone. HashiCorp's offerings have widescale adoption in the developer community and are used by 85% of the Fortune 500. Their community products across infrastructure and security were downloaded more than 500 million times in HashiCorp's FY2024 and include:\nTerraform – provides organizations with a single workflow to provision their cloud, private datacenter, and SaaS infrastructure and continuously manage infrastructure throughout its lifecycle\nVault – provides organizations with identity-based security to automatically authenticate and authorize access to secrets and other sensitive data\nAdditional products – Boundary for secure remote access; Consul for service-based networking; Nomad for workload orchestration; Packer for building and managing images as code; and Waypoint internal developer platform\nUnder the terms of the agreement, IBM will acquire HashiCorp for $35 per share in cash, or $6.4 billion enterprise value, net of cash. HashiCorp will be acquired with available cash on hand.\nThe boards of directors of IBM and HashiCorp have both approved the transaction. The acquisition is subject to approval by HashiCorp shareholders, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.\nThe Company's largest shareholders and investors, who collectively hold approximately 43% of the voting power of HashiCorp's outstanding common stock, entered into a voting agreement with IBM pursuant to which each has agreed to vote all of their common shares in favor of the transaction and against any alternative transactions.\nThe transaction is expected to close by the end of 2024.\n1 The total cloud opportunity is the sum of the cloud-directed spends across Hardware, IT services and SW for Private and Public cloud implementation, sourced from IDC's Worldwide Black Book Live Edition, March 2024 (V1 2024)\nIBM's regular quarterly earnings conference call is scheduled to begin at 5:00 p.m. ET, today.

    "content": ",  /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced new efforts that apply its geospatial AI technologies, including IBM's geospatial foundation model developed in collaboration with NASA, to climate efforts including analysis of urban heat islands in the United Arab Emirates (UAE); reforestation across Kenya; and climate resiliency in the United Kingdom (UK).\nIBM continues to advance its AI model strategy in part through the creation, training, fine-tuning and open-sourcing of foundation models – models that can be used for different tasks and apply information from one situation to another – designed for domains beyond natural language, including geospatial applications.\nThese models, which are trained on geospatial information such as satellite images, present a unique opportunity to address climate change because unlike traditional AI models tailored for specialized tasks, geospatial foundation models – encompassing satellite and weather data – create knowledge representations from petabytes and exabytes of climate-relevant data that can facilitate accelerated and streamlined discovery of environmental insights and solutions. These models can also be fine-tuned and applied across a multitude of areas driving or revealing climate change, from flood detection to fire scars.\n\"Climate change is a real and pressing issue that we must find new ways to address as quickly and efficiently as possible, including through today's most advanced AI technologies,\" said Alessandro Curioni, IBM Fellow and Vice President, Accelerated Discovery at IBM. \"AI foundation models utilizing geospatial data can be a game-changer because they allow us to better understand, prepare and address the many climate-related events effecting the health of our planet in a manner and speed never before seen. We are hopeful these technologies can help accelerate the rate at which we derive and apply solutions for a safer and healthier planet for future generations.\"\nAnalyzing urban heat islands in the UAE\nBy the end of this century, many cities will likely experience disruptive and excessive heat waves if GHG emissions continue at high levels. To develop sustainable and equitable plans to keep cities habitable, the rising heat levels must be accurately mapped and addressed.\nIBM and the Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) are pioneering an attempt to apply foundation models to the mapping of urban heat islands – areas with significantly higher temperatures compared to surrounding locations. This innovative research specifically applies a fine-tuned version of IBM's geospatial foundation model to understand the urban environment in Abu Dhabi and how the underlying landscape in the UAE impacts the formation of urban heat islands.\nTo date, the model has informed efforts that have succeeded in a reduction of heat island effects in the region by more than 3oC (5.4 F)1. Going forward, the model is expected to continue to provide unique insights that inform the development of urban design strategies designed to help reduce urban heat stress in changing climates.\nProfessor Tim Baldwin, MBZUAI Acting Provost, said: \"Our collaboration with IBM marks a groundbreaking effort to utilize foundational AI models in analyzing and identifying solutions to urban heat islands for Abu Dhabi and parts of the UAE, a region which is particularly affected by climate change. This research underscores the vital role of AI in tackling global issues, emphasizing the urgency of continued exploration and innovation. By harnessing the power of AI, we are not merely addressing challenges; we are proactively shaping solutions for a sustainable future. In a world confronted by unprecedented challenges, MBZUAI stands at the forefront of pioneering research in AI, recognizing the transformative power it holds.\"\nAdvancing reforestation and water sustainability in Kenya\nIn December 2022, President of Kenya H.E. D.R William Ruto unveiled the National Tree Growing and Restoration Campaign designed to plant 15 billion trees across Kenya by 2032, including in areas of critically affected water towers – forested landscapes that retain water and source many rivers throughout Kenya. While water towers account for about three quarters of the nation's water resources, deforestation is contributing to increasing water scarcity in these regions.\nIBM and the Kenyan government's office of the Special Envoy for Climate Change Ali Mohamed have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to support the National Tree Growing and Restoration Campaign through a new \"adopt-a-water-tower\" initiative. The effort will be fueled by a new digital platform that leverages IBM's geospatial foundation model to enable users to track and visualize tree planting and tree growing activities in specific water tower areas. Local developers can also create fine-tuned models combining the IBM geospatial model with their own localized information to monitor forest restoration and measure above-ground biomass such as sequestered carbon, ultimately mobilizing on-the-ground efforts to plant more trees across Kenya's water tower regions.\nThe President's Spokesperson, Mr. Hussein Mohamed, MBS, said: \"We recognize that technology plays a pivotal role in unlocking our full potential, optimizing resource utilization, and seizing opportunities. It serves as a means to ensure that we harness our resources most effectively to drive our grassroots-driven economic transformation agenda. Through our partnership with IBM, we have the capability of harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and geospatial data to advance our climate ambitions. These ambitions include planting 15 billion trees, rejuvenating our vital water towers, fostering increased collaboration with the private sector to promote a just energy transition for communities around our forests. Simultaneously, this collaboration will enhance our capacity to equitably participate in the carbon economy. The potential of this collaboration extends beyond our borders and has the capacity to be replicated in other nations seeking to enhance their forest cover while also improving the economic and health well-being of their communities.\"\nElevating climate resiliency across the United Kingdom\nIn 2021, IBM and the Science and Technology Facilities Council's (STFC) Hartree Centre collaborated to explore the application of next-generation technologies including AI from IBM to address climate risk and resiliency across the UK.\nNow, IBM, STFC and Royal HaskoningDHV, a global consulting engineering company, have collaborated to establish a new service, leveraging IBM's geospatial AI tools, that seeks to automate and scale climate risk assessment processes for organizations. The service's first use case will focus on the aviation sector, in which IBM's geospatial AI will assess impacts weather-related issues, including:\nShort-term impact of extreme weather on aviation operations.\nLong-term impact of climate change on future airport operations and infrastructure.\nIn addition, IBM and STFC Hartree Centre, through the Hartree National Centre for Digital Innovation, are advancing a new area of research with Dark Matter Labs and Lucidminds, as part of their TreesAI project. The research project will apply IBM geospatial AI technologies to their Green Urban Scenarios (GUS) model to map urban locations where trees can be planted to help alleviate the risk of surface water flooding. The effort will eventually inform an end-to-end digital planning platform for urban planners, project developers and green urban investors across the UK.\nKate Royse, Director at STFC's Hartree Centre, said: \"There has never been a more important time to prepare for the challenges posed by climate change, both from an industrial and societal perspective. Here at STFC's Hartree Centre we're excited to be working with IBM and Royal HaskoningDHV, using advanced AI technologies to help the aviation industry prepare for climate risks, and become more resilient against the effects of extreme weather. Equally, our collaboration with IBM and Dark Matter Labs on the TreesAI project through our HNCDI programme will enable smarter decisions based on accurately predicting and managing flood risk, which is critical to all future city planning. Advanced AI technologies are key driver in enabling us to build a more resilient world against the adverse impacts of climate change.\"\nDjeevan Schiferli, Climate Intelligence Business Strategist, Royal HaskoningDHV said: \"Operational and strategic planners in every company require a clear understanding of how weather and climate-related incidents affect their business operations. By harnessing AI and geospatial data, we will super charge our climate risk assessments on a global scale.\"\nChloe Treger, TreesAI UK Lead, said: \"Over 300,000 properties are at risk of surface-water flooding. Without action, this figure is set to almost double by 2055 due to climate change and urbanisation. Through our collaboration with IBM and STFC, we have been able to observe how trees contribute to reducing surface water flooding risks across the city under different scenarios, using GUS. This has enabled us and our partners to make the business case for tree planting and maintenance. After a successful pilot in Glasgow, we are now looking for further locations to embed this powerful data-enabled decision-making tool.\"\nExtending NASA collaboration to apply generative AI to weather\nBeyond their initial commitment to build and deploy a geospatial foundation model, IBM and NASA have also announced work on a new, separate AI foundation model for weather and climate. By applying AI technology from IBM, the model aims to improve the accuracy, speed and affordability of weather forecasting and other climate applications. Sample applications of the model not only include forecasting, but also super-resolution downscaling, identifying conditions conducive to wildfires, and predicting meteorological phenomena. IBM researchers will work alongside NASA domain experts to train and validate the model.\nThese latest efforts and IBM's role at COP28 builds on the company's long history of action, research, and advocacy around the environment. IBM issued its first environmental policy more than 50 years ago, in 1971, and published a formal position on climate change in 2007. IBM is also a founding member of the United Nations Environment Programme's Science-Policy-Business Forum on the Environment and the Climate Leadership Council, and supports communities vulnerable to climate change and other environmental issues through initiatives like the IBM Sustainability Accelerator.\nTo follow IBM at COP28, please visit: https://www.ibm.com/events/unfccc-cop\nIBM is a leading provider of global hybrid cloud and AI, and consulting expertise.

    "content": ",  /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) and The All England Lawn Tennis Club today announced a new feature for the Wimbledon digital experience that will leverage match data with generative AI from IBM's AI and data platform, watsonx, to keep fans updated on the world's leading players as they advance through The Championships.\nThe new 'Catch Me Up' feature displays pre and post-match player cards with AI-generated player stories and analysis via wimbledon.com and the Wimbledon 2024 App. Player cards will be personalised based on user preferences and data such as their location and myWimbledon profile, starting with their favourite players. Pre-match content will include analysis of recent performance and likelihood to win predictions, and post-match it will include key statistics and highlights. The feature will also create longer-form daily summaries of play.\n'Catch Me Up' was built using IBM's Granite large language model (LLM) to provide AI-generated text using the capabilities of the watsonx platform. The model has been trained on the Wimbledon editorial style and will be monitored by the All England Club. The new feature is designed to help Wimbledon scale its content to both new and existing tennis fans globally, as well as provide fans access to timelier, curated coverage across ladies' and gentlemen's singles matches which are often happening simultaneously.\nThis year, Wimbledon will also use generative AI to provide coverage of a broader range of matches than was previously available, including wheelchair events, to offer more to Wimbledon's diverse international audience. This will form part of a redesigned digital match centre, known as IBM Slamtracker, available on the Wimbledon App and wimbledon.com. Using generative AI built from watsonx, IBM Slamtracker has been enhanced to  provide bullet point-based match previews and post-match reviews for ladies' and gentlemen's singles matches.\nMajority of tennis fans surveyed positive about AI\nThe announcement comes as new research from IBM and Morning Consult* reveals that 55% of global tennis fans surveyed think AI will have a positive impact on sports. When considering how generative AI could improve their experience, these respondents prioritised real-time updates (36%), personalised content (31%), and unique insights (30%).\nApproximately one-third (31%) of global tennis fans surveyed use multiple devices while watching sporting events, primarily to get more information, watch multiple matches at the same time, and interact with other fans. In addition, nearly half (47%) of them engage with additional content on tennis daily or weekly and rank summarisation and personalisation as the two most important features of sports content.\nChris Clements, Digital Products Lead at the All England Club, said: \"We are committed to offering fans the highest quality Wimbledon experience, whether it's in person or digitally. Generative AI allows us to scale our ability to provide different types of content for fans wherever they are in the world in a way that's personalised for them. This year's new Catch Me Up feature will make it easier for fans to follow the key storylines as they emerge throughout The Championships.\"\nJonathan Adashek, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications for IBM, said: \"The new Catch Me Up feature is an exciting example of how we can use the power of generative AI to deliver compelling, insight-driven storytelling at scale. For 35 years, IBM and Wimbledon have been co-creating solutions that make fans feel more connected to all the on-court action, and our new research confirms they are beginning to understand the positive impact technologies such as generative AI can have on their digital experiences. IBM is also putting these same technologies from our AI and data platform watsonx into the hands of clients worldwide, across nearly every sector, to address their unique business needs.\"\nAdditional highlights from the IBM and Morning Consult survey include:\nMajority of global tennis fans surveyed think technology will have a positive impact on multiple aspects of the sport – for fans, coaches and players alike\n60% of tennis fans surveyed think technology will have a positive impact on the advancement of fan engagement.\nMore specifically, 75% of tennis fan respondents think technology will have a positive impact on the advancement of training; game strategy (74%); coaching (71%); and talent identification & acquisitions (66%).\nNearly a third of global tennis fans surveyed use more than one device to watch multiple matches at once, get more information and interact with other fans\n24% of tennis fans surveyed use two devices; 5% report using three devices and 2% report using more than three devices at the same time.\n45% of the surveyed tennis fans who use multiple devices do so to get more information while watching tennis; 32% do it to watch multiple matches simultaneously; and 30% do so to interact with other fans while watching a match.\nMore than one-fifth of UK sports fans surveyed use at least two devices simultaneously to consume sport\n20% of UK sports fans surveyed use two devices at the same time when watching sports, close to the global average of 22%.\nSports fans surveyed aged between 18-29 in Canada are much more likely to use three or more devices at once when watching sports (21%), compared with 7% in the UK and a global average of 10%.\nIn the UK, respondents identified multi-tasking (50%) and finding more information (41%) as the top reasons for multi-device sport consumption. 26% also said they use multiple devices to interact with other fans.\nThe Championships, Wimbledon will run from 1-14 July, 2024.

    "content": "- Alabama Community College System, Bay Area Community College Consortium, Colorado Community College System, and Louisiana Community and Technical College System will offer students access through IBM SkillsBuild this fall- Credentials have been piloted and designed with community college experts, and have ACE recommended college credits\n,  /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) today unveiled two new IBM SkillsBuild certificates in cybersecurity and data analytics, which have been piloted and designed with community colleges. These new IBM SkillsBuild certificates will be available to students across the Alabama Community College System, Bay Area Community College Consortium, Colorado Community College System, and Louisiana Community and Technical College System this fall.\nCybersecurity and data analytics skills are essential for artificial intelligence (AI) innovation, enabling professionals to extract insights, secure critical information, drive informed decisions, and create value across industries in an increasingly data-centric and security-conscious world. According to a global study conducted by IBM Institute of Business Value, executives estimate that implementing AI and automation will require 40% of their workforce to reskill over the next three years, mostly those in entry-level positions. This underscores the importance of creating public-private partnerships to help close the skills gap.\n\"Community colleges play a critical role in advancing the adoption of essential technology skills for the workforce,\" said Lydia Logan, Vice President for Global Education and Workforce Development, IBM Corporate Social Responsibility. \"With these new credentials, IBM is helping learners gain the in-demand skills employers are seeking in a new AI-enabled workplace.\"\nThe certificates are designed to meet the needs of learners and have been developed with academic and industry experts. Community college programs can integrate them into existing curriculums for students to earn credits.\nDesigned to meet the needs of learners: These certificates are accessible for first-time degree seekers, upskillers, or career changers who hold a high school degree or GED, associate degree, or a bachelor's degree in a non-technical field. Self-paced, experiential learning across all levels helps effectively prepare learners for potential job opportunities such as junior information security analyst, network security technician, data visualization specialist, and entry-level marketing analyst.\nDeveloped together with academic and industry experts: Jobs for the Future (JFF) and a coalition of industry experts contributed to and validated the new competency-based IBM SkillsBuild certificates to align coursework and learnings with current employer demand as well as trends and expectations in the market to maximize job opportunities for students upon completion. The experts included representatives from employers including banks and tech firms, as well as schools and education nonprofits nationwide.\nIntegrate into existing community college programs for college credits: Each certificate learning plan is 60-65 hours in length and can be integrated into a community college's curriculum. The American Council on Education (ACE) has conducted a Learning Evaluation Review of the certificates and recommends 12 credits for completion of the IBM SkillsBuild Cybersecurity Certificate and 8 credits for the IBM SkillsBuild Data Analytics Certificate. The coursework also aligns with CompTIA SEC+ certification topics and skills and is recognized by potential employers.\nThe new certificates from IBM SkillsBuild require completion of the following courses:\nIBM SkillsBuild Cybersecurity Certificate: governance, risk, compliance and data privacy, vulnerability management, system and network security, cloud security, security operations management, and incident response and system forensics.\nIBM SkillsBuild Data Analytics Certificate: data classification, data usability for organizations, inferential and descriptive statistics, data collection and analysis, data preparation for analysis, and data visualization and presentation.\nAdditionally, students will have access to IBM SkillsBuild including other credentials and more than 1,000 free courses such as AI, sustainability, cybersecurity, data analytics, cloud computing, and workplace skills.\nThe new certificates were piloted successfully with students in Alabama, Colorado, California, and Louisiana in 2023.\n“I’m thrilled that, in collaboration with IBM, the Colorado Community College system is launching two new certificates in Cybersecurity and Data Analytics. These build on Colorado’s workforce development efforts that connect Coloradans with skills needed to fill in-demand good-paying jobs in the innovative sectors of the future. Colorado students will now have more opportunities to gain critical skills for AI, innovative tech, cybersecurity jobs, and more,” said Governor Polis.\n\"Alabama community college worked with IBM to pilot the Cybersecurity Certificate because of the strong need for entry-level competency-based credentials that help students start on a pathway for an IT career,\" said Dr. Courtney Monette, Special Programs Project Director, Alabama Community College System. \"In 2021, Alabama adopted a skills-based workforce training program called Mobilizing Alabama Pathways, or MAPs, that allows new and returning adult education and career pathway students an opportunity to earn a credential like the IBM SkillsBuild Cybersecurity or Data Analytics Certificate; thus building confidence and basic employability skills for all high demand high wage career clusters.\"\n\"Using the IBM SkillsBuild Cybersecurity credential for my two community education Cybersecurity Fundamentals courses that I piloted at Diablo Valley College during last fall and spring semesters, proved to be a rewarding experience for the student participants, for me, and for the college,\" said Richard Grotegut, Computer Network Technology Faculty at Diablo Valley College, part of the Contra Costa Community College District and a member of the Bay Area Community College Consortium. \"It confirmed the college's decision to offer the course as part of their academic offerings beginning this coming school year. The credential proved to be a very good entry-level introduction to cybersecurity. While most of the participants enhanced their academic credentials and are pursuing further study, several of the course \"career-changers\" used their success in the class to gain employment in technical support positions with local companies. The rich course content and approach, with a strong focus on oral and written communication skills, was a key factor in building the confidence that helped the students land those jobs.\"\n\"Front Range Community College is thrilled to have been selected as one of four colleges nationally to collaborate in designing and launching the new IBM SkillsBuild data analytics credential,\" said Colleen Simpson, EdD, Front Range Community College President. \"This collaboration with renowned technology leader IBM provides our students the opportunity to develop critical skill sets in this rapidly growing field.\"\n\"Baton Rouge Community College was excited to work with IBM in piloting this initiative last year,\" said BRCC Chancellor Dr. Willie E. Smith. \"We look forward to continuing this collaboration and working with IBM to expand the initiative and offer it to Louisiana citizens through the Louisiana Community and Technical College System. Through this collaboration, we are demonstrating a commitment to equipping our residents with the skills and practical experience required to excel in the high demand fields of cybersecurity and data analytics. Together, we are paving the way for Louisiana to emerge as a national leader in these rapidly growing sectors, ensuring our talent is prepared to navigate the challenges and seize the opportunities of the future.\"\n\"In an increasingly dynamic economy shaped by fast-evolving technology, employers, learners, and workers need nimble and trusted ways to acquire and validate skills that will lead to quality jobs of the future,\" said Joel Vargas, Vice President of JFF's Education Practice. \"JFF is proud to work with IBM and these innovative colleges to lead the charge on creating scalable solutions to meet this growing need.\"\nIBM's work with community colleges is an important component of the company's pioneering skills-first approach and part of IBM's commitment to providing 30 million people with new skills needed for the jobs of tomorrow by 2030.\nIBM SkillsBuild is a free education program aimed at increasing access to technology education. Through the program, IBM supports adult learners, and high school and university students and faculty, to develop valuable new skills and access career opportunities. The program includes an online platform that is complemented by customized practical learning experiences delivered in collaboration with a global network of partners.\nThe open version of IBM SkillsBuild is an online platform offering over 1,000 courses in 20 languages on AI, sustainability, cybersecurity, data analysis, cloud computing, and many other technical disciplines — as well as in workplace skills such as design thinking.

    "content": "Liberty Mutual has backed out of at least two potential litigation insurance deals after a $1.6 billion judgment it underwrote was reversed, according to three people familiar with the situation. The company was among a group of insurance providers that issued policies covering the massive 2022 judgment for Houston-based BMC Software in a suit against IBM, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. An appeals court last week overturned the decision, siding with IBM and leaving Liberty and other insurers on the hook. The judgment was insured for between $500 million and $750 million in total, according to people familiar with the situation, with Liberty covering between $100 million and $150 million of the policy. The ruling has sent ripples through the growing judgment preservation insurance industry, in which underwriters offer policies to successful plaintiffs guaranteeing at least a portion of lower-court awards. Some carriers in recent months have reduced the percentage of judgments they’re willing to cover and increased pricing, according to Jason Goldy, global team leader for Alliant Insurance’s Litigation & Contingent Risk Practice. Goldy spoke generally about the industry, declining to comment specifically on the IBM case and other cases. “In the last six months you’ve seen these adjustments and I would think that you’re likely to see them accelerated if there are material losses,” Goldy said. The people familiar with Liberty’s judgment insurance dealings spoke on condition of anonymity to preserve business relationships.“Liberty Mutual Insurance does not publicly discuss individual commercial insurance customers,” said Richard Angevine, a company spokesperson. Lawyers for BMC from Bracewell LLP and White & Case did not respond to requests for comment. At least one of the deals that Liberty backed out of was “sizeable,” according to a person familiar with the situation.Michael Perich, head of litigation insurance at Lockton, said over the last year larger judgments have become more difficult—and expensive—to insure. Perich spoke generally about the judgment insurance landscape, declining to comment specifically on the IBM case.He said he’s seen an uptick in the number of litigation insurance opportunities including portfolio transactions, in which policies are issued across multiple cases rather than for single lawsuits. “The market is fluid and it’s proven the ability to adapt to things,” Perich said. “Nothing is set in stone. This is what we’ve noticed the past year or so but it can change over time.”Massive JudgmentA federal judge in Houston ruled in May 2022 that IBM poached BMC’s software business with a mutual client, AT&T. The court ordered IBM to pay $1.6 billion to the KKR-backed company, an amount believed to be one of the largest ever judgments in a commercial dispute.BMC later obtained insurance policies from Liberty and an unknown number of other carriers securing at least part of the judgment. The details of the coverage have not been made public. These kinds of insurance deals have become more common amid the surge in litigation finance, a burgeoning industry in which outside funders invest in lawsuits. Judgment preservation insurance is offered as a hedge for investors, lawyers, or parties in cases that have already been decided by lower courts and are subject to appeal.IBM appealed the BMC decision, arguing that it fairly won the business from AT&T. Lawyers for BMC in multiple court filings have generally acknowledged the role of insurers: “A group of insurers also has a financial interest in the outcome of this litigation.” IBM was represented by Clement & Murphy and Yetter Coleman. The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit shot down the ruling against IBM on April 30. A three-judge panel said the company lawfully obtained the AT&T business. BMC indicated in a May 2 filing that it is likely to seek a rehearing in the appeals court.Alliant’s Goldy said judgment preservation insurance deals will continue to get done.“The market is still going to write the product,” Goldy said. “You just need to navigate risks through those hurdles or adjustments but the market will survive, it will continue, and it will adjust.”The case is BMC Software v. IBM, 5th Cir., No. 22-20463, decision 4/30/24",

    "content": "Happy birthday, IBM! You’re 100 years old! Or are you?It’s true that the businesses that formed IBM began in the late 1800s. But it’s also true that a birth occurred in February 1924, with the renaming of the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. as the International Business Machines Corp. And a hundred years after that event, it serves as an important reminder that the world of computing and IT that IBM played a pivotal role in building has a longer history than we are likely to think. “Data processing” was coined over a century ago, while “office appliance” was in use in the 1880s. From the 19th century, through the 20th, and into the 21st, IBM was there, making HP, Microsoft, and Apple appear more like children or grandchildren of the IT world; Facebook, Google, and Twitter/X more like great-grandchildren. So let’s take a moment to contemplate the origins of an iconic corporation.The Assembling of IBM’s PartsBack in the late 19th century, as the U.S. economy gave birth to important large enterprises—telecommunications, railroads, manufacturing—the need to coordinate the work of individuals and dispersed locations led to the mechanization of information. Hence the emergence of typewriters, adding machines, and cash registers. Time-recording devices tracked when workers arrived and left, while scales weighed everything from meat at a butcher shop to industrial machine parts. For the 1890 U.S. census, Herman Hollerith’s punch-card tabulators calculated the nation’s population.Workers punched in and out on a dial recorder, sold by C-T-R’s International Time Recording Co.IBM Corp.To provide these various products, countless little companies popped up, most of them lost to history. But at least three survived. One came into being in 1900 as the International Time Recording Co., in Endicott, N.Y. ITR soon became known as the company for time-recording products in the United States and Canada. It had been formed and shaped by Charles Flint, a dynamic character known for consolidating several companies into U.S. Rubber and several other companies into the American Chicle Co.—also known as the Chewing Gum Trust—and for his love of sailing and airplanes. In 1901, Flint acquired the Computing Scale Co., which made tabletop scales popular with grocers in the Midwest. Over time, the company added cheese slicers and office furniture.This showroom in Melbourne, Australia, displayed products from all three of IBM’s founding companies: scales, time recorders, and tabulating machines.IBM Corp.In 1911, the Washington, D.C.–based Tabulating Machine Co. came into Flint’s orbit. Created in the 1880s and widely successful almost from its birth, TMC—maker of Hollerith’s punch-card tabulating equipment—produced the kind of breakthrough technology that large enterprises and government agencies desperately needed, to support massive undertakings like the census as well as inventory control and logistics. Herman Hollerith’s punch-card tabulators were used in the 1890 U.S. Census.IBM Corp.That same year, Flint smashed the three pieces together to form an entity that he unimaginatively called the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co., or C-T-R. The scales business was okay, the time-recording business was booming, and the tabulating business had enormous potential but had yet to demonstrate it could keep up with demand. The creation of C-T-R yielded a company with promise, but the three entities didn’t coordinate or leverage one another’s assets and talents.Charles Flint [left] acquired the three companies that became the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co., or C-T-R, and he hired Thomas J. Watson Sr. to build the business. IBM Corp.Flint convinced his board of directors to hire a professional manager to see what could be done to grow the entire business. Enter Thomas Watson Sr. in 1914, a highly successful sales executive who had recently spent two decades working at the National Cash Register Co.—considered one of the best-run “cool” companies of the early 20th century. He was 42 when he arrived at C-T-R. Hollywood handsome, smart, mature, and confident in his skills as an executive working in the high-tech end of the economy, he quickly sized up the situation and went to work.Thomas J. Watson Sr., hired in 1914, propelled C-T-R into a high-tech data-processing enterprise.IBM Corp.Watson brought in technical and sales colleagues from NCR, figured out who in C-T-R to take seriously, dismissed dissidents and incompetents, and sought ways to integrate all three pieces of the company. He concluded that the greatest potential for growth lay with Hollerith’s tabulators, so he focused on growing that market. Meanwhile, ITR had a popular product and, almost as important, a presence in Europe. The scales business, though, was a ho-hum opportunity as far as Watson was concerned, so he paid far less attention to it.Watson integrated sales—his strong suit—across all three businesses, and trained the team to become a highly skilled, professional staff. His newly hired engineers, meanwhile, improved manufacturing operations.The start of World War I blocked sales in Europe, but not in the United States. When the United States entered the war in 1917, government and private sector demand for C-T-R’s products grew rapidly. The end of the war opened up Europe’s huge market, and smaller ones in South America and parts of Asia.Birth of a Corporate CultureSlowly and steadily, Watson was creating a new corporate culture of ethics, paired with competent sales, solid technology, and a growing international perspective. The previously disjointed three-legged operation increasingly embraced his notion of “speed, accuracy, and flexibility,” in which the customer always came first. Despite a short recession at the start of the 1920s, C-T-R was emerging as a serious and well-run high-tech data-processing enterprise.Under Watson’s leadership, C-T-R’s revenue, staff, and product lines continued to grow. IBM Corp.In 1914, the company had generated US $4 million in revenues (about $120 million today) with 1,346 employees; in 1920, revenues were $14 million, with 2,731 employees. In 1922, a recession year, C-T-R brought in only $9 million, but its staff had climbed to 3,043—solid evidence that Watson considered the recession a mere bump in the road. And for the next six decades, the company continued to grow. Not until the late 1980s did the company again face declining revenues (then measured in the billions of dollars) and a shrinking labor force (then in excess of 400,000).In 1923, Watson, his executives, and employees collectively looked toward a future without immediate threats of war, where large organizations had embraced the concept of data processing powered by mechanical devices. Watson oversaw a rapidly expanding company that was grabbing market share away from competitors. He concluded that C-T-R’s future lay in pursuing a worldwide strategy, one for which he now had enough factories, sales offices, and trained employees. To be sure—and this is an important lesson for today’s startups—it had taken him a decade to reach the point where he could sit comfortably in his office in New York and imagine the next phase of C-T-R. As a preamble to that future, he decided that the company’s image and reputation required some burnishing. He considered what the public knew about the firm, what the company stood for, what its brand would be, and how its reputation should be shaped. It was time, Watson decided, for a name upgrade.IBM Gets Its NameOn 15 February 1924, TheWall Street Journal published a short article on page 3, announcing that the “International Business Machines Corp. has been incorporated under the laws of New York to take over business and assets of Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co.” That’s how the world learned about the existence of IBM (that is, unless they worked in Canada, where employees had known their employer as IBM since 1917).In a 13 February 1924 letter to employees, Thomas Watson unveiled IBM’s new name.IBM Corp.When Watson had been remaking C-T-R, he already thought the company’s name was awkward and uninspiring, but too many other issues required his urgent attention. In early 1924, though, he decided it was time. On 13 February 1924, Watson published a letter addressed to all employees to announce the change, explaining: “Our new name is particularly adaptable and suitable to our business, in view of the fact of our increasing growth, the consistent development of additions to our line, and our products covering such a wide range in the field of business machinery.” He concluded, “We are confident that this change in name will be beneficial to the business, and that the members of our field organization will find it of direct value in introducing our company and the products which we manufacture and distribute.”The name change was also significant to C-T-R’s customers and vendors, and IBM salesmen rushed to explain how wonderful it would be. Then there was this little story in The Wall Street Journal three months after IBM’s incorporation. It may not have been true, but it suggests that everything comes down to execution. The article began by stating that some people were confused by the name, which it called “unwieldy,” and maybe this episode really did happen:The other day an uptown merchant called up a friend in Wall Street and inquired if he had ever heard of a new concern called the International Business Machines Corp.“We have a big order from them,” he said, “and I am trying to check up on their credit rating. My partner has just gone downtown to demand a balance sheet from them.”“Well,” said the broker, “in their last balance sheet they showed $800,000 cash and about $8,000,000 current assets. Their position seems pretty good. How big was the order?”“About $100,” said the merchant. “Wait a minute, I want to head off my partner.”Implicit in that story was the real business problem of retaining the positive reputation of C-T-R while leveraging its new name to build business momentum. Watson and his colleagues spent the rest of the 1920s and 1930s creating a brand image that reflected their positive view and plans for the future but that also translated into transactions, profits, growth, and prestige. They battled ignorance of what their products could do, invented new products, hired people, expanded operations, overcame the worldwide tragedy of the Great Depression, and endured an antitrust challenge in the 1930s, the first of several.The name change ultimately signaled a larger transformation underway. Whether the firm should have had a different name than IBM was less important than that Thomas Watson felt it was time to declare a grander purpose for the company. The tone of his comments, the nature of the company’s communications, and the way its staff interacted with the media and with customers evolved almost as a step change after the adoption of the new name. Watson was declaring that IBM wanted to become a major player in its industry and a leading international corporation. And so it did.This article is adapted from excerpts of the author’s award-winning book, IBM: The Rise and Fall and Reinvention of a Global Icon(MIT Press, 2019).",

    "content": "We’re just at the beginning of an AI revolution that will redefine how we live and work. In particular, deep neural networks (DNNs) have revolutionized the field of AI and are increasingly gaining prominence with the advent of foundation models and generative AI. But running these models on traditional digital computing architectures limits their achievable performance and energy efficiency. There has been progress in developing hardware specifically for AI inference, but many of these architectures physically split the memory and processing units. This means the AI models are typically stored in a discrete memory location, and computational tasks require constantly shuffling data between the memory and processing units. This process slows down computation and limits the maximum achievable energy efficiency.IBM Research has been investigating ways to reinvent the way that AI is computed. Analog in-memory computing, or simply analog AI, is a promising approach to address the challenge by borrowing key features of how neural networks run in biological brains. In our brains, and those of many other animals, the strength of synapses (which are the “weights” in this case) determine communication between neurons. For analog AI systems, we store these synaptic weights locally in the conductance values of nanoscale resistive memory devices such as Phase-change memory (PCM) works when an electrical pulse is applied to a material, which changes the conductance of the device. The material switches between amorphous and crystalline phases, where a lower electrical pulse will make the device more crystalline, providing less resistance, and a higher electrical pulse makes the device more amorphous, resulting in more resistance. Instead of recording the usual 0s or 1s you would see in digital systems, the PCM device records its state as a continuum of values between the amorphous and crystalline states. This value is called a synaptic weight, which can be stored in the physical atomic configuration of each PCM. The memory is non-volatile, so the weights are retained when the power supply is switched off.phase-change memory (PCM) and perform multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations, the dominant compute operation in DNNs by exploiting circuit laws and mitigating the need to constantly send data between memory and processor.To turn the concept of analog AI into a reality, two key challenges need to be overcome: These memory arrays need to be able to compute with a level of precision on par with existing digital systems, and they need to be able to interface seamlessly with other digital compute units, as well as a digital communication fabric on the analog AI chip.In a paper published today in Nature Electronics, IBM Research made a significant step towards addressing these challenges by introducing a state-of-the-art, mixed-signal analog AI chip for running a variety of DNN inference tasks. It’s the first analog chip that has been tested to be as adept at computer vision AI tasks as digital counterparts, while being considerably more energy efficient.The chip was fabricated in IBM’s Albany NanoTech Complex, and is composed of 64 analog in-memory compute cores (or tiles), each of which contains 256-by-256 crossbar array of synaptic unit cells. Compact, time-based analog-to-digital converters are integrated in each tile to transition between the analog and digital worlds. Each tile is also integrated with lightweight digital processing units that perform simple nonlinear neuronal activation functions and scaling operations.Each tile can perform the computations associated with a layer of a DNN model. The synaptic weights are encoded as analog conductance values of the PCM devices. A global digital processing unit is integrated in the middle of the chip that implements more complex operations that are critical for the execution of certain types of neural networks. The chip also has digital communication pathways at the chip interconnects of all the tiles and the global digital processing unit.Using the chip, we performed the most comprehensive study of compute precision of analog in-memory computing and demonstrated an accuracy of 92.81% on the CIFAR-10 image dataset. We believe this to be the highest level of accuracy of any currently reported chips using similar technology. In the paper, we also showed how we can seamlessly combine analog in-memory computing with several digital processing units and a digital communication fabric. The measured throughput per area for Giga-operations per second (GOPS) by area is a standard metric for describing compute efficiency where raw compute operations are normalized by a concomitant compute area. It essentially shows that there are more operations for a given area, meaning this chip is a more efficient compute engine.8-bit input-output matrix multiplications of 400 GOPS/mm2 of the chip is more than 15 times higher than previous multi-core, in-memory computing chips based on resistive memory, while achieving comparable energy efficiency.By combining the area- and energy-efficient analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), highly-linear multiply–accumulate-compute, and capable digital compute-blocks of this 64-tile chip with massively-parallel data-transport that we showed off in a 34-tile chip presented at the IEEE VLSI symposium in 2021, we now have demonstrated many of the building blocks needed to realize an architectural vision for a fast, low-power analog AI inference accelerator chip.Using our learning we have designed an accelerator architecture like this which was published earlier this year in IEEE Transactions on VLSI systems. Our vision combines many analog in-memory computing tiles with a mix of special-purpose, digital compute-cores connected with a massively-parallel 2D mesh. In conjunction with sophisticated hardware-aware training we have developed in recent years, we expect these accelerators to deliver software-equivalent neural network accuracies across a wide variety of models in the years ahead.",

    "content": "Today, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) and IBM officially unveiled the world’s first-ever IBM quantum computer on a university campus. Building on RPI’s bicentennial celebration of 200 years of firsts, IBM Quantum System One will significantly enhance educational and research opportunities for the university, as well as with other academic institutions and organizations across the New York region that wish to partner with RPI. Faculty, researchers, students, and collaborators accessing the system will aim to advance quantum computing research, including the search for quantum algorithms that could lead to quantum advantage, while also actively building the next generation of the quantum workforce alongside IBM. The system at RPI was unveiled today at a ribbon-cutting ceremony featuring remarks from RPI President Marty A. Schmidt ’81, Ph.D.; IBM Chairman and CEO Arvind Krishna; Congressman Paul Tonko (NY 20); President of the University at Albany Havidán Rodríguez; Vice Chair of RPI Board of Trustees Curtis R. Priem ’82; Board of Trustees Chair John E. Kelly, III ’78G, ’80Ph.D., D.H.L. (Hon.); and RPI Quantum Computing Club Co-President Michael Papadopoulos.Located in the university’s historic Voorhees Computing Center Chapel, the IBM Quantum System One, along with endowed faculty positions, is the focal point of the Curtis R. Priem Constellation. The constellation, made possible with the philanthropic support of Curtis R. Priem ’82, vice chair of RPI’s Board of Trustees, will enable collaborative quantum computing research at RPI.“Standing at the forefront of quantum computing as the first university to host an IBM Quantum System One is a fitting celebration of RPI's pioneering legacy in our bicentennial year,\" said RPI President Marty A. Schmidt. \"With trustee Curtis Priem's support and our enduring partnership with IBM, we'll utilize advanced computing for global problem-solving and train future quantum professionals, aiming to establish the Capital Region as a hub for quantum innovation – our own ‘Quantum Valley’. Our students are eager to explore quantum computing's applications in addressing our toughest challenges and I'm excited to witness the creativity of both our students and faculty researchers as they unlock quantum's potential to shape a better future.”“IBM is proud to build on our partnership with RPI. Together, we can unlock new frontiers in quantum research, science, and engineering,” said Arvind Krishna, Chairman and CEO, IBM. “This collaboration will help explore some of the world’s most complex problems and train the next generation of quantum experts.”The new IBM Quantum System One at RPI is powered by a 127-qubit IBM Quantum ‘Eagle’ processor, to offer RPI’s network of researchers, students and partners dedicated access to a utility-scale quantum computer. In 2023, IBM demonstrated the ability of IBM Eagle to produce accurate calculations beyond classical, brute-force simulation methods. Known as quantum utility, this signaled the start of an era in which quantum systems can serve as scientific tools to explore problems in chemistry, physics, materials, and other fields in the search for quantum advantage: the point at which a quantum computer can solve a problem better than any known classical method.The system now online at RPI is joining IBM’s global fleet of utility-scale quantum computers available via the cloud and at dedicated client sites, including systems in the United States, Canada, Germany and Japan, and installations in progress in South Korea and Spain. As quantum computing hardware and software continues to advance, RPI’s world-class academic body of students, researchers, and faculty will progress the global race to discover increasingly complex quantum. “For the first time in history, an entirely new branch of computing is being developed with quantum technology. This is not something we can do alone,” said Dario Gil, IBM Senior Vice President and Director of Research, and RPI board member. “It is fundamental that IBM works with our global ecosystem of partners, including world-renowned universities and research institutions such as RPI, to discover and map new algorithms to the most difficult challenges that quantum computers can solve. We will do this by fostering a quantum workforce of the future and ensuring that the next generation is equipped with the skills to use these systems to their fullest potential.”RPI and IBM have a long-standing and storied history of collaboration to advance technology. This includes RPI’s current housing of the Artificial Intelligence Multiprocessing Optimized System (AiMOS). AiMOS is presently the most powerful classical supercomputer at a private university in the United States and is equipped with POWER9 CPU and NVIDIA GPU technology to enable users to explore new AI applications.“As an RPI graduate and a trustee deeply invested in RPI’s mission and future, partnering with IBM to introduce quantum computing on our campus was a natural step forward,” said Curtis R. Priem, RPI Class of 1982 and vice chair of the RPI Board of Trustees. “RPI’s commitment to providing students with access to cutting-edge tools and ubiquitous computing is paramount, and integrating an IBM Quantum System One helps ensure we're doing are part to develop tomorrow's quantum workforce.”“Unveiling the IBM Quantum System One during RPI’s bicentennial year is a fitting statement about our commitment to technological leadership and innovation during the university’s third century,” said John Kelly, RPI Class of 1978. “The RPI community looks forward to seeing how our faculty, students, partners will work together to explore quantum computing’s applications in health, pharmaceuticals, sustainability, artificial intelligence, national security, and more.”As the first university in the world to house an IBM Quantum System One on its campus, RPI has a unique opportunity to develop new quantum curriculum and educational programs aimed at upskilling the quantum workforce. As IBM and RPI build initiatives to prepare the future talent base of technology workers, the organizations expect their joint learnings to influence global workforce development and skills-building programs. “As a proud representative of New York’s Capital Region, I am thrilled to see RPI and IBM unveil the world’s first-ever IBM Quantum System One on a university campus right here in Troy,” said Congressman Paul Tonko (NY 20). “This groundbreaking collaboration will not only provide opportunities to accelerate quantum computing research and train the next generation of the computing workforce, it will also reinforce our region’s status as a global hub for the advancement of cutting-edge technologies. Through initiatives like the CHIPS and Science Act and partnerships like this one, we are paving the way for a future of innovation and high-tech manufacturing here in our Capital Region — ensuring our communities remain at the forefront of technological advancement.”Since planning for the installation of IBM Quantum System One began in June of 2023, RPI has hosted IBM researchers on its campus for introductory lectures and presentations to help students build a foundational understanding of the opportunities in quantum computing. Now, dedicated access to leading quantum hardware and software, powerful supercomputing resources, and educational and technical support from IBM will help educate and shape the technology workforce as students develop skills across quantum and classical computing paradigms — critical to accelerating New York’s continued growth as a leader in next-generation computing.",

    "content": "IBM plans to end 5% matching contributions and 1% automatic contributions to employees’ 401(k) accounts in favor of an automatic 5% retirement benefit provided to all employees, starting January 1, 2024, a company spokesperson confirmed by email.The technology corporation will still allow employees to make deferrals into a 401(k), but it will direct 5% of each employee’s salary into what it terms a “Retirement Benefit Account,” according to a spokesperson and details from a company memo posted to a conversation on the web site Reddit.“IBM is introducing a new company-provided benefit for U.S. employees called the Retirement Benefit Account within the existing IBM Personal Pension Plan, which helps save for retirement automatically, with no contribution required from the employee,” explained the spokesperson by email. “The RBA adds a stable and predictable benefit that diversifies a retirement portfolio and provides employees greater flexibility and options.”IBM employer contributions were based on an internal IBM pension formula that varied depending on an employee’s eligibility for the IBM Personal Pension Plan as of December 31, 2007, and a different set of options for those hired on or after January 1, 2005, according to the firm’s 2022 Form 5500, filed in July 2023.Currently, IBM automatically enrolls new employees into the DC plan at 5% of eligible salary and performance pay after approximately 30 days of employment with IBM, unless they elect otherwise. New hires become eligible for the IBM automatic contribution and the IBM matching contribution after completing the applicable service requirement, which generally is one year.Additionally, in plan year 2022, “matching and automatic contributions were made once annually at the end of the year. In order to receive such IBM employer contributions each year, a participant must be employed on December 15 of the Plan year, and meet all eligibility requirements,” according to information included in the 2022 Form 5500.Participants in the existing IBM plan are fully vested at all times “in their account balance, including employee contributions, employer contributions and earnings thereon, if any,” according to information in the 2022 Form 5500. The IBM memo said the company plans to end matching contributions in a change planned as part of continued improvements to support workers’ well-being.“By introducing this retirement benefit within IBM’s Personal Pension Plan, which is stable and well-funded, IBM is able to provide a benefit to IBMers that also helps diversify their retirement portfolios,” the leaked IBM memo stated. “We periodically benchmark the benefits IBM offers compared to industry peers, and 5% is aligned to the market—but in addition, with the RBA, no employee contribution is required.”Additional text of the leaked document included a description of the “key features of the Retirement Benefit Account”:Guaranteed 6% annual interest rate for the first 3 years; Tax-deferred growth; Even when the market declines, your balance will not; No enrollment necessary. No investment decisions to make; and Immediately vested and portable.  ‘Concerning’ for EmployeesIBM planning to end the employer match is uncommon, says Rob Massa, managing director and Houston operations retirement practice leader at Qualified Plan Advisors.“The U.S. [private] retirement [system] is a voluntary one and, as long as a plan sponsor follows the law and IRS/[Department of Labor] regulations and administers the plan in accordance with its plan document, they may make any plan design settlor (i.e., non-fiduciary) decisions in any way they prefer,” he says. “The decision to eliminate the match is legally acceptable, and there is no fiduciary liability associated with it.”Phillip Hulme, chief financial adviser and COO at Atlanta-based Stars & Stripes Financial Advisors, explains that the move by IBM is “concerning for employees.”IBM is shifting risks for retirement benefits from the company and onto employees by taking away workers’ matching contributions, which means they will be “earning less,” Hulme says.The leaked IBM document addressed some of the differences to the existing plan, called the IBM 401(k) Plus Plan. “[W]e recognize 5% is less than employees are eligible to receive through the current 401(k) Plan,” the memo stated. “To offset the difference, IBM is providing a one-time salary increase effective January 1, 2024, separate from the annual salary plan later in the year.”IBM reported in a September 2022 SEC filing about its transfer of $16 billion worth of defined benefit pension plan obligations to Prudential Financial and MetLife, one of the biggest pension risk transfer deals ever. The IBM defined benefit plan was frozen to new hires in 2006.In the 2022 plan year, 168,865 IBM retirement plan participants held retirement balances in the IBM 401(K) Plus Plan, comprising more than $53.3 billion in total assets, as of the latest data available.RebrandPlan adviser Massa had not previously heard of a plan sponsor offering something called a “Retirement Benefit Account.”“However, under the law, a plan sponsor can name any retirement plan anything they want,” he says. “For example, while most plans use the [IRS’] IRC [Internal Revenue Code] Section 401(k) in the name of their salary deferral plans, there is no requirement to use that term.”Employees will become eligible for the RBA regardless of whether they participate in any other IBM retirement plan, but similar to eligibility for the 401(k) plan, the new benefit has a one-year service requirement, according to the memo.“Based on what has been shared from IBM, this sounds like a cash balance plan,” adds Massa. “IBM currently sponsors a cash balance plan called the ‘IBM Personal Pension Plan,’ and my educated guess is that they are either using this program and rebranding it or constructing a new cash balance plan and calling it the IBM Retirement Benefit Account Plan. Cash balance plans are designed to have both a contribution credit (i.e., 5% per year) and an earnings credit (e.g., 4% per year). So that’s my best guess as to what they are up to.”  Cash balance plans share some similarities with both DC and DB plans but are regulated as defined benefit plans.  IBM’s plan to eliminate the company match was first reported by The Register, a technology news website based in the U.K. Early reporting was based off of a leaked internal IBM memo and a note on LinkedIn from adviser Hulme, a former IBM employee who says he was aware of the move.“On the face of it, I see no [Employee Retirement Income Security Act] issues or legal risks with what they are doing,” says Massa. “But going forward, if this is a cash balance plan, IBM would be assuming the investment risk on the cash balance plan portfolio and will also be assuming the cost of PBGC premiums.”  Despite IBM’s uncommon move to end retirement plan matching contributions, the company should not face legal issues under ERISA, agrees Drew Oringer, a partner in and general counsel at the Wagner Law Group.“The entire private retirement system is voluntary, and IBM has no obligation to continue or provide any particular ongoing benefit,” says Oringer. “An employee benefit, like a 401(k) plan, is in many ways nothing other than another part of the overall compensation package that includes basic salary.”",

    "content": "In a busy week for security information and event management (SIEM) vendors to be merged or divested, Palo Alto Networks (PANW) announced that it’s acquiring IBM’s QRadar software-as-a-service (SaaS) business and migrating those customers to its Cortex® XSIAM® platform. In addition, PANW gets QRadar intellectual property rights as part of the deal.\nThis makes IBM the second legacy SIEM player (the other being LogRhythm) this week to attach itself to a newer, more innovative vendor. These moves come on the heels of Cisco’s completed acquisition of Splunk. All legacy SIEM players are facing increasing competition from tech titans (aka hyperscalers) as well as extended detection and response (XDR) vendors that are aggressively positioning as SIEM alternatives.\nIBM Security Is Exiting The QRadar Business …\nIBM has sold QRadar for well over a decade, since its 2011 acquisition of Q1 Labs. It made QRadar the focal point of its security product portfolio — going so far as to rebrand its endpoint detection and response (EDR) and security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) acquisitions under the QRadar banner. However, the vendor has faltered in recent years as it attempted to shift the offering to the cloud. Customers were frustrated with a perceived lack of innovation from IBM Security, leading to its release of QRadar Log Insights and QRadar SIEM SaaS. Now, it’s selling off its QRadar SaaS assets to Palo Alto Networks, the largest and most vital of which is QRadar SIEM.\nPANW is a more recent addition to the SIEM game, announcing Cortex XSIAM, its security analytics platform, in early 2022. It quickly gained customer interest through its automation capabilities, its use as the platform for its managed detection and response (MDR) capability, and its bundling with Cortex XDR. However, getting to the scale of customers that legacy SIEM vendors and some of the bigger players have is a long road. Its acquisition of QRadar SaaS assets is like finding a mushroom on the track in Mario Kart — it’s going to speed things up a bit.\nAt its core, this acquisition is about the QRadar customer base. According to the announcement, current “qualified” QRadar SaaS customers will be provided a no-cost migration path to Cortex XSIAM by IBM and PANW. Not only that, but “qualified” QRadar on-prem customers will be offered no-cost migration option as well. PANW clearly does not have long-term plans for the QRadar SaaS offering, nor likely its brand name (though it will own that, too).\nYou don’t need expertise in the occult to figure this one out: As soon as contractual obligations run out, existing QRadar SaaS customers need to embrace XSIAM or migrate to a different vendor. They should also find out quickly if they are qualified for the no-cost migration to Cortex XSIAM.\nTo any organizations considering a QRadar purchase: Choose a different vendor or evaluate Cortex XSIAM and cut out the middleman. Current QRadar customers must rethink their approach to security operations (SecOps) and determine if Cortex XSIAM is the right path forward, or if they should plan a transition to another vendor.\nQRadar customers (especially on-premises customers) that just made a purchase or are in the implementation process can take some solace in the fact that sunsetting products typically takes time, so you have some breathing room. You must consider, however, how quickly you can migrate to avoid the inherent technical debt of building on a product which will be on life support and eventually end-of-life.\n… And It’s Exiting Security Operations More Broadly, Too\nIBM Security considers its EDR offering (its ReaQta acquisition), threat intelligence (IBM Security X-Force Threat Intelligence), QRadar SOAR, and Randori Recon to be QRadar SaaS assets, which means Palo Alto Networks will own those as well. Customers of any of those products should expect the same outcome as QRadar SIEM: migration to Palo Alto Networks products or to a different vendor.\nAnother once-prominent component to IBM’s SecOps story, Watson, is almost a footnote in the announcement. As part of the partnership, PANW “intends to integrate watsonx large language models into Cortex XSIAM.” Watson, as the first AI assistant for security, never delivered on its promise to change SecOps.\nIBM Basically Becomes A Palo Alto Networks VAR\nOn the services front, PANW extends and expands its existing partnership with IBM. It’s using IBM for deployment, implementation, and ongoing managed security services for QRadar SaaS until it can migrate customers to XSIAM. PANW features several of the large global systems integrators as partners, but IBM is the only one that once owned a portion of its product portfolio, suggesting tighter ties to the company than the alternatives.\nThe partnership positions IBM as a PANW reseller and integration partner, where IBM will train 1,000 consultants on PANW products and take on nonstrategic deployment, implementation, and management work. In the short term, customers looking for PANW implementation work should consider more experienced providers as IBM consultants ramp up.\nThe Rest Of The Announcement Is Partnership Hype\nThe announcement goes on to describe a deeper partnership between IBM and Palo Alto Networks in areas including watsonx, a joint security operations center (with cyber ranges), DevSecOps, and other products and services.\nFor the most part, consider these opportunities for these two vendors to hype portions of their portfolios. Partnerships come and go and generally leave customers wanting, so don’t expect big, transformative wins out of the rest of the announcement for you or your security team.\nSecurity Analytics Market Changes Will Continue … Still\nIn our previous blog, we predicted that the changes in the security analytics market weren’t over, and we were right faster than we knew.\nThe security analytics platform market will continue consolidating as XDR vendors are aggressively pushing into the SIEM space with the goal of being the primary SecOps tooling. This is the biggest concession of a SIEM vendor to an XDR vendor so far and signals a sea change for the threat detection and response market. Security buyers may be finally getting the SIEM alternative they’ve been seeking for years.\nForrester clients can schedule an inquiry or guidance session with us to discuss their options with IBM and Palo Alto Networks moving forward.",

However, sometimes AI algorithms produce outputs that are not based on training data, are incorrectly decoded by the transformer or do not follow any identifiable pattern. In other words, it “hallucinates” the response.\nThe term may seem paradoxical, given that hallucinations are typically associated with human or animal brains, not machines. But from a metaphorical standpoint, hallucination accurately describes these outputs, especially in the case of image and pattern recognition (where outputs can be truly surreal in appearance).\nAI hallucinations are similar to how humans sometimes see figures in the clouds or faces on the moon. In the case of AI, these misinterpretations occur due to various factors, including overfitting, training data bias/inaccuracy and high model complexity.\nPreventing issues with generative, open-source technologies can prove challenging. Some notable examples of AI hallucination include:\nGoogle’s Bard chatbot incorrectly claiming that the James Webb Space Telescope had captured the world’s first images of a planet outside our solar system.1\nMicrosoft’s chat AI, Sydney, admitting to falling in love with users and spying on Bing employees.2\nMeta pulling its Galactica LLM demo in 2022, after it provided users inaccurate information, sometimes rooted in prejudice.3\nWhile many of these issues have since been addressed and resolved, it’s easy to see how, even in the best of circumstances, the use of AI tools can have unforeseen and undesirable consequences.",

    "content": "HashiCorp is known for its Terraform product, an infrastructure automation tool, which is considered an industry standard for infrastructure provisioning in hybrid and multicloud environments.\nIn a move that significantly bolsters its position in the cloud services market, IBM has announced it is acquiring HashiCorp, a multicloud infrastructure automation company, for $6.4 billion.\nHashiCorp is known for its Terraform product, an infrastructure automation tool, which is considered an industry standard for infrastructure provisioning in hybrid and multicloud environments.\nIn the statement, the company said HashiCorp’s suite of products offers “enterprises with extensive Infrastructure Lifecycle Management and Security Lifecycle Management capabilities,” which enable businesses to automate their hybrid and multicloud environments. “Today’s announcement is a continuation of IBM’s deep focus and investment in hybrid cloud and AI, the two most transformational technologies for clients today.”\n“This is a great acquisition for IBM to formally plug a big gap in the hybrid cloud market which includes Infrastructure Lifecycle Management as well as Security Lifecycle Management, as most enterprises’ primary focus remains on Application Lifecycle Management but not on the structural foundation driving the application,” said Neil Shah, VP for research and partner at Counterpoint Research.\n0 seconds of 1 hour, 14 secondsVolume 0%\n“Since IBM’s software business has been on the rise in recent times and its consulting business is not doing that great, this (HashiCorp’s acquisition) makes a right fit there,” said Techarc’s chief analyst and founder, Faisal Kawoosa. “Every company is trying to see how AI can help automate processes> That is where I see this acquisition is fitting right into IBM’s scheme of things because IBM has a lot of AI-related order books already confirmed, so instead of getting into tool and applications development, the acquisition makes a good sense here.”\nThe deal is expected to close by the end of 2024, the statement added.\nAddressing the challenge of hybrid cloud complexity\nThe complexity of managing multicloud and hybrid environments has become a daunting task for enterprises in recent times with the rise of cloud-native applications and generative AI (GenAI) deployments. The acquisition of HashiCorp by IBM fortifies IBM’s position in the rapidly growing AI and cloud computing market, two game-changing technologies shaping the future of how enterprises operate.\n“Enterprise clients are wrestling with an unprecedented expansion in infrastructure and applications across public and private clouds, as well as on-prem environments. The global excitement surrounding generative AI has exacerbated these challenges and CIOs and developers are up against dramatic complexity in their tech strategies,” Arvind Krishna, IBM chairman and CEO, said in a press statement. “HashiCorp has a proven track record of enabling clients to manage the complexity of today’s infrastructure and application sprawl. Combining IBM’s portfolio and expertise with HashiCorp’s capabilities and talent will create a comprehensive hybrid cloud platform designed for the AI era.”\nManaging the infrastructure lifecycle is often an afterthought or is assumed to be done by the systems integrator or the cloud infrastructure provider, Shah noted. “But it is becoming more and more complex for enterprises with variety and velocity of workloads in a hybrid cloud setting with different policies, security, troubleshooting, migrations, feature updates across clouds,” Shah said. He said with the onset of GenAI integrations, it would become even more complex and would need greater automation and policy management. “This is where IBM can gain an edge with HashiCorp’s capabilities and potential customers,” he added.\nWhat IBM gains from HashiCorp acquisition\nIBM’s acquisition of HashiCorp strengthens the company’s play in the hybrid cloud and DevOps market. HashiCorp’s well-regarded open source tools, particularly Terraform, bolster IBM’s portfolio and provide a path to attract a wider developer base, potentially fostering further innovation, said Prabhu Ram, head for Industry Intelligence Group at CyberMedia Research (CMR).\nCombining IBM’s existing cloud solutions with HashiCorp’s infrastructure automation tools is expected to create a robust platform for managing hybrid and multi-cloud environments. “Our strategy at its core is about enabling companies to innovate in the cloud while providing a consistent approach to managing cloud at scale. The need for effective management and automation is critical with the rise of multi-cloud and hybrid cloud, which is being accelerated by today’s AI revolution,” Armon Dadgar, HashiCorp co-founder and chief technology officer, said in a statement.\nNotably, HashiCorp’s multicloud focus aligns with the market’s increasing demand for flexibility, said CMR’s Ram backing the move. “By integrating these capabilities with its established customer base, IBM can create significant cross-selling opportunities. The combined entity positions IBM as a more comprehensive player in a fiercely competitive landscape, addressing the needs of both traditional infrastructure and emerging AI-driven workloads.”\nBesides, the HashiCorp acquisition is also expected to accelerate growth for IBM in areas such as RedHat, watsonx, IT automation, and data security. “IBM has done well with RedHat acquisition and has maintained its independence and openness, and if it can follow the same with this acquisition without a hard upsell of its offerings, IBM can become a key open player in the hybrid cloud market,” Shah said.",

    "content": "OverviewIn-memory computing (IMC) is an emerging non-von Neumann computational paradigm that keeps alive the promise of achieving energy efficiencies on the order of one femtoJoule per operation in a computing system. The key idea is to perform certain computational tasks in place in memory, thereby obviating the need to shuttle data back and forth between the processing and memory units. The time and energy cost associated with this data movement is by far the most severe roadblock for modern computing systems.IMC is often achieved by exploiting the physical attributes of the memory devices, their array-level organization, etc. IMC has found application in a range of applications such as scientific computing, database query, machine learning etc. However, the most promising application for IMC is for efficient realization of deep neural networks (DNNs) that have revolutionized AI in recent years. A key challenge for DNNs is its computational inefficiency. In fact, the lack of sufficient compute power was one of the key factors that held back progress in the field for almost 30 years. More specialized hardware such as graphical processing units and application specific ICs have had a significant impact on the hardware realization of DNNs and helped unleash the recent AI revolution. However, even with better hardware, there is a significant energy gap to be bridged to unleash the true potential of AI.In our group we are exploring custom accelerators for DNNs based on IMC. The essential idea is to realized attributes such as synaptic efficacy and plasticity in place in the memory itself by exploiting the physical attributes of memory devices. Physically stationary neurons and synapses along with lower precision analog computation are key salient features of biological neural networks and hence this work also comes under the purview of neuromorphic computing.\nWe have designed and fabricated, in collaboration with other members of the IBM Research AI Hardware Center, the most advanced IMC compute chips or Analog AI chips for deep learning to date.We have assembled a highly multidisciplinary team that tackles the entire stack namely, the memory technology, mixed-signal circuit design, system-level architecture, the software stack and applications. As far as memory technology is concerned, our primary focus is improving the compute density, compute precision and weight capacity. There is also substantial research effort aimed at improving the energy efficiency of the peripheral circuitry associated with the IMC cores. The overall system-level architecture of a multi-core IMC chip as well as the appropriate communication fabric is being actively researched. The software stack that spans the hardware-aware training libraries down to the compiler and is being actively developed. Finally, in the application front, we explore neural architectures that are particularly well-suited for this new kind of accelerators. We are also exploring applications that transcend conventional deep learning inference such as more bio-realistic DNNs, neuro-vector symbolic architectures, etc.Selected externally funded projectsHorizon Europe NeuroSoC Horizon Europe EIC Pathfinder HYBRAIN Horizon Europe EIC Pathfinder BioPIM H2020 FET Open WiPLASH H2020 ICT FunCOMP H2020 ICT MNEMOSENE European Research Council (ERC) Consolidator grantRecent key publications:\nJain et al., “A heterogeneous and programmable compute-in-memory accelerator architecture for analog-AI using dense 2-D mesh”, IEEE Trans.

    "content": "There’s something of a trend around legacy software firms and their soaring valuations: Companies founded in dinosaur times are on a tear, evidenced this week with SAP‘s shares topping $200 for the first time.\nFounded in 1972, SAP’s valuation currently sits at an all-time high of $234 billion. The Germany-based enterprise software provider was valued at $92 billion two years ago, and $156 billion 12 months back, meaning its market cap has grown more than 50% in the past year alone.\nSAP shares surged on June 27, 2024.Image Credits: Ycharts\nMarket valuations shouldn’t be conflated with company health, but it’s a useful indicator of how a company is doing — whether that’s through actual financial performance or meaningful moves it’s making to shift with the times.\nSAP AGM: SAP’s former chairman Hasso Plattner (M), CEO Christian Klein (L), and chairman Pekka Ala-Pietilä\nImage Credits: Uwe Anspach/picture alliance via Getty Images\nCEO Christian Klein has overseen SAP’s turnaround since 2020, focusing on helping customers transition to the cloud while striking useful partnerships with hyperscalers such as Google and Nvidia along the way.\nSAP’s rapid rise can partly be attributed to this transition from an old-school license model, with its Q1 2024 report revealing year-on-year cloud revenue growth of 24%, a figure it said it expects to rise further in the next 12 months due to its “cloud backlog” income in the pipeline. Injecting “business AI” across its cloud suite is also playing a part in this trajectory.\nReports emerged last year that its on-premises customers had become disgruntled with how SAP was putting its new technology into its cloud products only. But rather than pandering, SAP’s doubling down on its push to bring them to the cloud, offering its on-prem customers discounts to make the transition — an AI carrot on a cloud stick, if you will.\nInvestment management company Ave Maria World Equity Fund recently highlighted SAP as one of its top three performers in Q1 2024, noting SAP’s transition “from a perpetual license model to a SaaS model” will create a larger total addressable market (TAM) and greater margins.\nOptimize your data infrastructure for today’s AI. | Online, August 20\nOptimize your data infrastructure for today’s AI. | Online, August 20\nAnd it’s such efforts that are driving the fortunes of SAP and similar legacy software companies, according to Gartner chief forecaster John-David Lovelock.\n“There are a few tailwinds aiding growth — preferences for cloud over on-premises systems, upgrades and expansion requirements,” Lovelock told TechCrunch. “But the primary effect is simply digital business transformation efforts that started in 2021 are ongoing.”\nOracle chairman and CTO Larry Ellison.Image Credits: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\nAnd what about Oracle, the U.S. database and cloud infrastructure company founded in 1977? Oracle is valued at more than $385 billion as of this week, 20% up on last year, though this figure was at almost $400 billion a couple of weeks back — far and away its highest ever valuation.\nThe reasons for this are roughly comparable to that of SAP: “AI-fueled cloud growth,” the result of a long transition away from an on-premises model.\nOracle’s recent valuation growth in a chart.Image Credits: Ycharts\nNotably, Oracle’s fiscal 2024 Q3 earnings saw the company pass a key milestone, with its total cloud revenue — that’s SaaS (software-as-a-service) plus IaaS (infrastructure-as-a-service) — surpassing its total license support revenue for the first time.\n“We have crossed over,” Oracle CEO Safra Catz said on the earnings call.\nAt its Q4 earnings, Oracle reported modest revenue growth of 3% — but this figure increased to 20% for cloud-specific revenue. And more is to come, says Catz, projecting double-digit cloud revenue growth in the coming financial year. This has been aided by partnerships with the likes of Microsoft, Google, and generative AI darling OpenAI, which are seeking all the cloud infrastructure they can get — OpenAI plans to use Oracle’s cloud to train ChatGPT.\n“In Q3 and Q4, Oracle signed the largest sales contracts in our history — driven by enormous demand for training AI large language models in the Oracle Cloud,” Catz said.\nAs with SAP, Oracle also recently inked a deal with Nvidia to help governments and enterprises run “AI factories” locally using Oracle’s distributed computing infrastructure.\nIt’s not all a rosy outlook, though: One of Oracle’s flagship customers, TikTok, is facing a ban in the U.S., with Oracle warning this week that this could affect its revenues in the future.\nIBM CEO and chairman Arvind Krishna speaking at the 2023 World Internet Conference Wuzhen Summit.Image Credits: Ni Yanqiang, Wang Jianlong, Li Zhenyu/Zhejiang Daily Press Group/VCG via Getty Images\nIBM, the company founded in 1911 as Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company, reached an 11-year high in March of $180 billion, just 6% off an all-time record.\nThe company’s valuation has fallen around 14% since then to under $160 billion, but it remains 30% up on last year.\nIBM’s recent valuation growth in a chart.Image Credits: Ycharts\nIBM was once a hardware company, with mainframes and PCs the order of the day, but “Big Blue” segued into a software and services company, which now makes up most of its revenue. IBM spun out its legacy infrastructure services business as a stand-alone entity called Kyndryl in 2021.\nIBM began its cloud journey in 2007 with Blue Cloud, continuing through the years with the launch of IBM Cloud and through milestone megabucks acquisitions such as Red Hat. In tandem, IBM has also pushed AI front and center, starting with IBM Watson and more recently a slew of AI services to support AI demand in the enterprise — this included the launch of Watsonx, which helps companies train, tweak, and deploy AI models.\n“Client demand for AI is accelerating, and our book of business for Watsonx and generative AI roughly doubled from the third to the fourth quarter,” IBM chairman and CEO Arvind Krishna said at its Q4 2023 earnings in January.\nIBM’s recent financials have been something of a mixed bag, with its Q1 2024 numbers showing a small revenue hike that missed analyst estimates and earnings that beat estimates. On the other hand, its consulting revenue fell slightly.\nHowever, two months on, analysts are bullish about IBM’s path, with Goldman Sachs this week giving IBM a “buy” rating off the back of its AI investments and continued focus on infrastructure software.\n“We believe that IBM is in the middle innings of pivoting its portfolio to a suite of modernized application and infrastructure software and a broader array of services, away from a legacy-focused portfolio,” Goldman Sachs’ analyst James Schneider said.\nIt’s too early to say how this sentiment will age, but IBM’s AI investments are paying dividends as far as Wall Street is concerned.\nSAP, Oracle, and IBM aren’t the only legacy software companies enjoying fruitful times. Intuit, a 41-year-old financial software company, hit the giddy heights of $187 billion last month, just a fraction below its Pandemic-era high of $196 billion. As with others, Intuit has been investing heavily in AI as part of its push to remain relevant, and this is the first thing it talks about at its earnings calls.\nAnd Adobe, founded in 1982, is also doing pretty well, with its valuation up 8% year-on-year to $236 billion — Adobe reported record Q1 and Q2 revenues with AI and cloud touted as pivotal to this growth.\nMicrosoft is the world’s most valuable company, a $3.3 trillion juggernaut whose shares have surged 33% in the past year. A decade in the hot seat, Satya Nadella has transformed Microsoft into a cloud-first, AI-first colossal company, having lost out on the smartphone gold rush due to prior missteps.\nMicrosoft turns 50 next year, and staying relevant after so many industrial, technological, political, and managerial shifts isn’t easy. But Microsoft hasn’t just remained relevant — its revenues, profits, and just about every other metric continue to surge, due to its investments in the cloud and, more recently, generative AI.\nWhile these companies are definitely benefiting from embracing new trends, there are other factors at play as well — in particular, investors don’t have many places to park their money to make bets on new technology.\nRay Wang, founder and principal analyst at Constellation Research, believes the decrease of competition in certain markets has helped drive investors toward the biggies.\n“There’s minimal competition as we are in oligopolies and duopolies,” Wang told TechCrunch. “We used to have hundreds of software companies, but decades of mergers and acquisitions have whittled down the options to a few companies in every geography, category, market size, and industry.”\nWang also pointed to the stagnant IPO market, as well as the impact of the private equity sphere, as reasons why legacy technology companies are doing well.\n“COVID killed the IPO market — we don’t have the startups of the past that can grow to become the next Oracle, SAP, or Salesforce. The pipe has been bad despite the number of software companies being started — they have not gotten to scale,” Wang said. “[And] a lot of the acquisitions by the PE firms have destroyed the spirt of entrepreneurship and [have] turned these companies into financial robots.”\nThere are many ways to slice and dice all this, but well-established software firms are ultimately better positioned to thrive when a game-changing technology such as AI comes along, owing to the fact they have a market presence and stable customer base.\nTheir respective cloud transitions are also a big part of the narrative, tying in neatly with the rise of AI, which is heavily dependent on the cloud.\nThey also have significant resources at their disposal, with strategic acquisitions playing a major part in their push to stay relevant: IBM is bolstering its hybrid cloud ambitions with its recent $6.4 billion bid for HashiCorp, while SAP revealed plans to pay $1.5 billion for AI-infused digital adoption platform WalkMe.\nAI might be having a minimal impact on companies’ bottom line today, but it’s a must-have as far as Wall Street is concerned: Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft have all hit record highs of late, and AI is a major part of it. Apple’s shares also hit an all-time high off the back of its recent AI announcements, even though “Apple Intelligence” isn’t available yet.\nThe AI tide might be lifting all boats at present, but Gartner’s famed “hype cycle” prophesizes that interest in new technology wanes as all the early experiments and implementations fail to deliver on their promise — this is what it calls a “trough of disillusionment.” This could be coming, according to Lovelock, meaning many of those billion-dollar generative AI startups could have something to worry about.\n“It’s easy to get lost in new and emerging software markets,” Lovelock said. “It is also hard to compete for attention when new AI companies are boasting multi-billion dollars of revenue within a few years of launch. However, traditional software markets have a combined annual revenue over $1 trillion in 2024 — legacy software sales are growing strongly, and AI’s strong growth has obfuscated this fact for many.”\nBusinesses that have been around for decades are better positioned to flourish due to their existing foothold. We might be in an AI bubble, but when mainstream adoption truly takes off, the SAPs, Oracles, and IBMs of the world will be better positioned to jump on it.",

    "content": "Amazon Web ServicesArtificial IntelligenceEnterprise Applications\nThis partnership will allow businesses in 92 countries access to IBM’s software products, including data technologies and AI, directly through the AWS Marketplace.\nIBM has announced the expansion of its software portfolio to 92 countries in AWS Marketplace, a digital catalog with thousands of software listings from independent software vendors (ISVs). Previously, the digital catalog was available in just five countries.\nThis strategic alliance allows businesses in these countries access to IBM’s software products, including data technologies and AI, directly through the AWS Marketplace, IBM said in a statement.\n“The expansion beyond Denmark, France, Germany, United Kingdom and United States, where the software is currently available, will help make procurement easier for clients, streamline purchasing and create new efficiencies, while allowing them to use their AWS committed spend for IBM software purchases,” the statement added.\n“By expanding the availability of our software portfolio in AWS Marketplace, organizations around the world will have greater access to a streamlined way to procure many IBM AI and hybrid cloud offerings to help propel their business forward,” Nick Otto, Head of Global Strategic Partnerships at IBM, said in the statement. “Our collaboration with AWS is a prime example of how we’re working with other companies to meet the needs of clients, making it as easy as possible for them to do business with IBM and accelerate their transformation journeys.”\n0 seconds of 8 minutes, 41 secondsVolume 0%\nIndustry analysts view this collaboration as a significant development in the cloud software industry.\n“Since AWS is the cloud infra leader with thousands of enterprises and many of them overlap with IBM and RedHat using their SaaS solutions. Strong synergies are coming out of this partnership,” said Neil Shah, VP for research, and partner at Counterpoint Research. “IBM’s highly-capable Watson AI platform and its RedHat open solutions, combined with AWS Cloud and Amazon Bedrock and IBM Consulting form a solid offering for enterprises. Further, it also offers some monetization and potential cross-selling opportunities for AWS to the IBM and RedHat clients.”\n“This will increase competition with some of the select SaaS vendors on the AWS platform who offer similar offerings,” said Rajiv Ranjan, associate research director at IDC. “In particular, it will make it easier for IBM software and IBM Watson customers on AWS to source these required software. There are other hybrid cloud, automation, and observability software on AWS. These software vendors will compete with IBM now for the above-mentioned customers.”\nA broader portfolio of solutions\nThis development allows customers in the 92 countries to access IBM’s AI and data technologies through a “portfolio of 44 listings and 29 SaaS offerings” including components of watsonx AI and Data platform, the company said in the statement.\n“Watsonx.data, a fit-for-purpose data store built on an open data lakehouse architecture, and Watsonx.ai, a next generation enterprise studio for AI builders are available in AWS Marketplace as well as two of IBM’s AI Assistants — watsonx Assistant and watsonx Orchestrate. Watsonx.governance is expected to be available soon,” IBM said.\nBesides, the expanded offering also includes IBM’s flagship database Db2 Cloud Pak for Data as well as a portfolio of automation software including Apptio, Turbonomic, and Instana, and the IBM Security and Sustainability software portfolios — all built on Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS. “The cloud-native software enables clients to deploy on AWS while flexible licensing, including SaaS and subscription, makes it easier for clients to purchase exactly how they want,” IBM said.\nIn addition to the software portfolio expansion, IBM is also launching 15 new consulting services designed specifically for AWS environments. “These new service offerings are aligned to client needs and demand, focused on data and application modernization, security services, and tailored industry-specific solutions — with generative AI capabilities included in select services,” the statement added.\nThe IBM and AWS collaboration underscores an emerging trend within the tech industry.  As the demand for cloud solutions continues to grow, collaboration between major tech players is likely to become commonplace.\n“It’s already common,” quipped Ranjan. “Customers on public cloud procure different software from the cloud marketplace. This helps to shorten the buying cycle if they are already in a specific cloud environment. Customers can get the same software at a lower cost if they buy from the marketplace as it would be a part of the overall contract with the cloud provider and gives the customer more negotiating power.”\nCiting a Canalys study that has forecasted software-as-a-service (SaaS) market to reach $45 billion by 2025, IBM said that marketplaces help “shorten the buying cycle, consolidate billing, and make it easier to scale software deployments quickly.” Canalys, in the study, said marketplaces are the “fastest-growing route to market” for SaaS products.\n“Online marketplace is offered in SaaS model that accounts for close to 60% of public cloud offerings,” Ranjan said.\nCloud Marketplaces are a haven for developers looking to build or discover and seamlessly integrate existing or new solutions respectively at scale, Shah said. “This allows the developers to adopt ready-made or quickly co-develop modules and APIs to accelerate their time to market and reduce the overall TCO. So, this extensive and deeper partnership is a win-win partnership for both AWS and IBM and their customers.” This is not only a win-win situation for the tech partners but also for the customers, Shah said. “Businesses gain access to a wider range of solutions and streamlined procurement processes, while cloud providers expand their offerings and user base,” he added.\nAI insights trends in data science\nBusiness and IT leaders can find out how to lower barriers to AI adoption by addressing issues with trust, value, and implementation.\nHow data literacy allows gen AI to drive productivity at Dow\nMelanie Kalmar, CIO and CDO of the $43 billion global materials science company, describes her approach to driving a culture that embraces the power of AI.\nBeyond AI: Building toward artificial consciousness – Part 3\nThis final part of the series will delve into the software solutions, which are vital for efficiently deploying and scaling AI models, a necessity for creating responsive and adaptable artificial consciousness.\nBy Eric Kern, distinguished engineer, Lenovo\nCISO viewpoint part 1: AI’s impact on people, policies & processes\nEnterprise CISOs are focusing on integrating AI to enhance operations while balancing ethical standards, intellectual property protection, and the well-being of employees and the company.\nFrom our editors straight to your inbox\nGet started by entering your email address below.",
