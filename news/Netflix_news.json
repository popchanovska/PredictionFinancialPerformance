    "content": "Apple’s Vision Pro headset won’t have a dedicated Netflix app at launch, according to a report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. The streaming giant reportedly doesn’t plan to launch an app specifically for Apple’s headset, nor does it want to make its iPad app compatible with the platform.The move means users won’t be able to watch Netflix in a dedicated app — like the other streaming services that have announced support for the headset, including Disney Plus, Max, Amazon Prime Video, and Paramount Plus. Instead, users will have to watch content from Netflix in a web browser, which will make the movies or TV shows wearers are watching far less immersive. It also will prevent users from watching content offline and could put limitations on resolution, as the video quality on Netflix’s web app varies by browser. While Netflix ended up creating an app for Meta’s lineup of Quest headsets, the app is pretty outdated.“Our members will be able to enjoy Netflix on the web browser on the Vision Pro, similar to how our members can enjoy Netflix on Macs,” Netflix spokesperson Kumiko Hidaka said in a statement to The Verge. Apple didn’t immediately respond to The Verge’s request for comment. Daring Fireball’s John Gruber says that Netflix has a version of its iPad app available for Vision Pro testers that had been working “just fine,” and the decision not to release it has little to do with member enjoyment: A little birdie informed me that until this week, the Netflix iPad app was available for those with access to Vision Pro hardware, and it worked just fine. This birdie still has the Netflix iPad app installed on their Vision Pro. Perhaps people at Netflix would disagree with just how well it worked — I don’t know — but I get the strong impression that the decision was political/strategic/spiteful, not technical.Netflix was notably not mentioned in Apple’s announcement yesterday that the Vision Pro will launch with 3D movies and experiences from Disney Plus and Apple TV. Netflix’s absence from the $3,499 headset might make the device less enticing for those who want to use it as a place to stream their favorite shows and movies.Update January 17th, 6:20PM ET: Added a statement from Netflix.Update January 19th, 4:48AM ET: Added John Gruber’s comments.Featured Videos From The VergeThe real reasons Apple won’t put macOS on the iPadApple has refused to put macOS on their iPads, but Apple users want to know, why not? Video director, Owen Grove, dives into answering this question by speaking to experts and trying to use the iPad Pro as his work device while mirroring macOS.",

    "content": "Netflix Inc. (NFLX) is a media company offering streaming entertainment subscriptions. Its digital platform allows subscribers to stream TV series, documentaries, and feature films on demand. The company also offers a range of mobile games.\nCompetition in streaming video entertainment has intensified in recent years with a number of media giants launching streaming platforms. Netflix's service faces competition from Walt Disney Co.'s (DIS) Disney+, Amazon.com Inc.'s (AMZN) Prime Video, Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) Apple TV+, and Peacock from Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) subsidiary NBCUniversal.\nNetflix operates a subscription streaming service offering a wide range of licensed and original entertainment programming, including movies and serials.The company generates almost 100% of its revenue from subscription services, with the U.S. and Canada accounting for the bulk of revenues while Latin America is the fastest-growing region.Netflix suspended its service and production work in Russia after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.In Q2 2023, the company rolled out its paid-sharing platform, whereby members who wish to share their account with people outside of their household must purchase an additional member slot to do so.\nOn July 19, 2023, Netflix announced financial results for the Q2 2023 quarter ended June 30, 2023. The company reported net income of $1.49 billion, up 3.24% from the year-ago quarter. Revenue for the quarter grew 2.72% year over year (YOY) to $8.2 billion.\nNetflix's global streaming paid memberships, a key metric, rose 8% YOY to a total of 238.39 million. Growth in the company's global streaming paid memberships has been consistent in the past four quarters from 220.67 in Q2 2022.\nThe company launched paid sharing in May 2023 in over 100 countries, representing more than 80% of the company's revenue base. Netflix expects to see increased revenues in the second half of 2023 as it fully realizes the benefits of paid sharing as well as growth in the company's ad-supported plan.\nNetflix does not sell its user data. Subscriptions are the predominant source of the company's revenue; however, now that the company has started a lower-cost membership that includes advertising, the company has been bringing in revenues through that channel. Streaming services are available in three tiers: Premium, Standard, and Standard With Ads.\nAlthough the company operates as a single business segment, Netflix does break out its revenue into four broad regions: the United States and Canada; Europe, Middle East, and Africa; Latin America; and Asia-Pacific.\nRevenue from the United States and Canada increased 1.72% from the same period last year to $3.6 billion in Q2 2023. The region remained Netflix's mainstay, accounting for approximately 44% of the company's revenue.\nEurope, Middle East, and Africa\nRevenue from Netflix's Europe, Middle East, and Africa region grew 4.27% YOY to $2.56 billion in Q2 2023. The region generated about 31.4% of Netflix's revenue.\nLatin America revenue rose 4.56% YOY to $1.08 billion in Q2 2023. Latin America was the fastest-growing region for the quarter. It contributed approximately 13.2% of Netflix's quarterly revenue.\nRevenue from the Asia-Pacific region increased 1.2% YOY to $919 million in Q2 2023. The region accounted for approximately 11.27% of the company's revenue.\nIn early March 2022, Netflix suspended its service in Russia following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The company reportedly had 1 million subscribers in the country, some of whom are now suing Netflix in Russia for withdrawing the service.\nIn May 2023, the country launched its paid-sharing service, which allows paying members to buy additional user slots to their accounts for users who do not live in their homes. Previously, anyone could share their Netflix account with anyone else; however, Netflix realized it was losing money this way and started to stop the process and monetize additional users.\nMembers will have to purchase an additional slot, the cost of which varies depending on the country and type of membership.\nIn April 2023, Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos announced that Netflix would be winding down its DVD rental service. On September 29, 2023, they will be shipping out their final discs.\nHow Much Revenue Does Netflix Generate?\nFor Netflix's year-end Dec. 31, 2022, the company generated revenues of $31.6 billion.

    "content": "A Netflix retelling of Giovanni Boccaccio’s The Decameron was not necessarily on my 2024 bingo card—but in hindsight, it probably should have been. Showrunner Kathleen Jordan’s medieval romp is perfectly of our era, despite taking place in the 14th century. After all, it’s held up by none other than the four horsemen of the current media zeitgeist: the anachronistic historical dramedy (see: Dickinson, My Lady Jane, Bridgerton), the “eat the rich” canon (see: White Lotus, The Menu, Triangle of Sadness), the schadenfreude of watching pretty, petty people revert to base instincts while trapped in one place (see: all of reality television, especially Big Brother, Love Island, and Bachelor in Paradise), and the frustrating trend of ever-increasing runtimes (see: everything ever). There’s also a dark horse at its center: it is, unapologetically, about the pandemic—something most media has shied away from depicting.\nIt helps, surely, that the central pandemic of The Decameron is a far less recent, far more mythologized one. All the soapy drama and raunchy slapstick stem from the characters’ desperate attempts to block out the devastating reality of the Black Death, which continues to ravage Italy with no signs of stopping. For all the liberties the series takes with the source material—and there are many; it is a loose adaptation the way a poncho is a loose rain jacket—it would be near impossible to have any version of The Decameron not revolve around the plague. Boccaccio’s famous book of short stories is framed around it, with the stories in question all being told by a group of nobles attempting to pass the time as they hide out from their native plague-ridden Florence in a beautiful country villa. Like a scooped bagel, Jordan’s adaptation takes the premise of a pandemic-induced Big Brother situation and hollows out the rest, replacing the bready goodness of Boccaccio’s mosaic with lots and lots of filling. And look, I love cream cheese as much as the next Jewish girl, but there is such a thing as too much of it, at which point I just start feeling a little sick. Despite the series’ noble attempts at class commentary and pandemic reverence, The Decameron gorges so thoroughly—and for hour-long episodes at a time—on zany shenanigans of both bloodlust and regular lust that it fails to leave much of a meaningful impression beyond a general sense of excess. It’s not bad, per se; I just wish there was a little less of it.\nThe Decameron is a true ensemble show, its characters fighting over screentime and each other in equal measure. Girls’ Zosia Mamet plays Pampinea, the elderly (read: 28) woman of the house, presiding over the villa in the conspicuous absence of her betrothed fiance, whom she’s never actually met. What she lacks in genuine connection to her missing future husband she makes up for in pathological obsession and diabolical power trips, which her handmaiden Misia (Derry Girls’ Saoirse-Monica Jackson, who puts those big eyes of hers to work in every scene) is the foremost recipient of. Their relationship often feels akin to Veep’s Selina Meyer with her bagman Gary Walsh, in all its toxic, mutually dependent glory. While Jackson is the Gary in that dynamic, Tony Hale (of Arrested Development and, yes, Veep fame) dons his typical manic, desperate-to-please, just a tad unhinged typecast to serve as the villa’s steward, a sharp contrast to the steely frustration of Stratilia (Leila Farzad), the long-suffering cook. There’s sexy doctor Dioneo (Amar Chadha-Patel, who rightfully called his character a “medieval fuckboy”) and his hypochondriac patient, the misogynistic, socially challenged nobleman Tindaro (Douggie McMeekin), who would feel right at home on Reddit and in a fedora. And I would be remiss not to mention the lavender marriage between the hyper-religious and hyper-horny Neifile (Lou Gala) and the surprisingly likable opportunist Panfilo (Karan Gill). Stealing the show, though, is Sex Education’s Tanya Reynolds, who manages to bring a believable humanity to the eccentric Licisca, a longtime servant to the bratty Filomena (Jessica Plummer) before, on a violent whim, taking the mantle of noblewoman for herself. The show’s plot is simple: 1) These beautifully costumed people are trapped in a gorgeous Italian villa together. 2) Hijinks ensue.\nLike many Netflix originals, The Decameron is often heavily tropey, but unlike its peers, that’s a fact it is gleefully aware of and often explicitly leaning into. And while that’s fun for a time, this purposeful soapiness makes not only its twists and turns but its jokes at large feel all too telegraphed well in advance. While some characters do develop and grow, they’re exactly the ones you would expect; others only sink to lower depths, always in the ways you anticipate. The show is funny in a broad sense—it’s funny to watch people act like idiots, sure. But when the baseline is so out-there, when everything is so over-the-top, it’s hard for any moment to stand out, for any joke to startle a laugh out of the viewer. Especially in Decameron’s early episodes, it feels as if the series has about three jokes that it just repeats at louder and louder decibels, each one outdoing the last iteration in terms of sheer zaniness: God-obsessed Neifile wants to jump a man’s bones (and so does her husband), the insufferable Dioneo is, in fact, insufferable, Pampinea is—gasp!—28, and so on and so forth.\nThe most unique aspect of The Decameron is, oddly enough, its willingness to engage (at least by proxy) with Covid-19—it’s not the only media that’s tried, certainly, but it comes closer to something approximating success than most others in the pandemic genre, which typically do little more than make you cringe in recognition. Decameron is strange to watch in our (largely) post-Covid existence today; we may feel tempted to roll our eyes at the characters’ attempts to block out the plague by shoving flowers up their nostrils, but it’s hard to judge them too harshly, considering the so-called leader of the free world once suggested injecting bleach into the human body to fight off our own modern virus. There is a certain kinship there, it’s true. However, much of Jordan’s Decameron falls short of truly capturing the experience of the pandemic—the calling card of that era was isolation, so it’s hard to watch a Bachelor in Paradise-esque (and, often, surprisingly violent) free-for-all and see much of ourselves in it. When I say I resorted to my “base instincts” during Covid, I mean I sat on my couch feeling bad about myself while doom-scrolling through Twitter so long my eyes glazed over. I don’t mean that I started trying to set people on fire.\nIn a lot of ways, Covid was a period of stagnation for many of us privileged enough to successfully quarantine—of not knowing what to do with ourselves, or how to find purpose in a life put on hold by global paranoia and the constant (even more so than usual) fear of death, or how to face the juxtaposition of one class’s self-imposed yet peaceful house arrest with the fact that “essential workers” were forced to labor on regardless. That’s something Boccaccio’s original Decameron excelled at depicting: his is a narrative of people telling each other tales for lack of anything else to do that would distract themselves from the devastation occurring just beyond their walls. The lavish chaos of the stories being told are starkly contrasted with the still, purgatorial existence of the nobles who have nothing to do but sit, talk, wait, and pray, as well as with the horrors faced by those unlucky enough to go without that privilege. Jordan’s Decameron, however, is altogether too busy—both too busy to properly capture that pandemic feeling, and too busy, period.\nPerhaps it’s this too-many-fingers-in-too-many-pies quality that inspired the series to carve out nearly an hour for each episode—meaning that the show clocks in at around eight hours in total, which is… quite a long time, for a show as constantly over-the-top as this. Excess and extremity are not necessarily bad in and of themselves, but ironically, they work best when in tandem with decisive restraint—of which The Decameron does not possess much (if it did, perhaps the show would be the half-hour caper it wants so badly to be). Zaniness and wackiness are all well and good, but when everything, from the jokes to the tears, is set at a 10 for eight straight hours, it’s hard to maintain enthusiasm, even when the show does. It gets, frankly, a bit wearying.\nThe Decameron is not all wackiness, however; Jordan makes many attempts at genuine feeling towards the end of the series’ run, but like the rest of the show, they’re often far too drawn out—overlong and excessive. Monologues abound in the final episodes, each character breaking down in tears as they finally come to terms with parts of themselves they would rather keep hidden. But just as nonstop, over-the-top antics lose their appeal after the freshness wears off, so too do emotional declarations. I found myself wishing for quieter moments, for a beat of respite once in a while—for connections formed and feelings felt without grand expository signposting to make sure we see they’re there. Amidst all of it, there are genuinely illuminating, great moments, like when a grieving Panfilo is told, point-blank, that everything is terrible and he will never recover, and he stops in his tracks, unable to do anything but laugh at the truth of it. But these bits often feel too few and far between—and they are far between, considering that the episodes are, again, an hour long.\nThe Decameron (Jordan’s, not Boccaccio’s) is evidently a lot of things. It’s “pandemic media,” through and through; it’s a lusty slapstick a la medieval!Love Island, as actress Reynolds put it; it’s soapy drama chock full of betrayals and tears; it’s a fairly self-explanatory class commentary, with servants and masters waging catty warfare against each other night and day. One thing it’s not, however, is The Decameron (Boccaccio’s, not Jordan’s). The Netflix series takes the framing of Decameron, but none of its innards, save for a reference or two. And that’s a shame: The Decameron might actually work incredibly well as an anthology show, with the outside plot continuing around the edges of each episode’s “day” of stories.\nI’m certainly no prude for historical reverence (for instance, I loved the sheer ridiculousness of My Lady Jane’s alternative history, wherein the “alternative” in question had a lot to do with the inexplicable presence of Animorphs-style shapeshifters) but by changing the premise so dramatically, Jordan’s Decameron loses not only its namesake, but its potential for originality. Because, when it comes down to it, The Decameron does little that has not already been seen: it’s simply My Lady Jane + Love Island + White Lotus. And since it’s so busy trying to accomplish all three of those oeuvres at once—while also attempting to establish a cohesive pandemic narrative—it falls just a little shy of a success in any one category. It’s fun to glut yourself on, but it’s more an indulgence than a satisfying meal, and by the time you reach the end, it’s hard not to wish you (like the characters) had indulged a little less.\nThe Decameron is now streaming on Netflix.\nCasey Epstein-Gross is a New York based writer and critic whose work can be read in Paste, Observer, The A.V.

    "content": "Netflix will no longer mail DVDs. See the company before streaming\nNetflix will send out its last red envelope on Friday, marking an end to 25 years of mailing DVDs to members.\nThe company announced earlier this year it is shutting down its DVD-by-mail service, 16 years after it gradually shifted its focus to streaming content online. Netflix will continue to accept returns of customers’ remaining DVDs until October 27.\nIntroduced in 1998 when Netflix first launched, the DVD service promised an easier rental experience than having to drive to the nearest Blockbuster or Hollywood Video. The red envelopes, which have long been synonymous with Netflix itself, littered homes and dorm rooms across the country.\nAlthough the idea of receiving a DVD in the mail now may sound almost as outdated as dial-up internet, some longtime customers told CNN they continued to find value in the DVD option.\nColin McEvoy, a father of two from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania and a self-described film fanatic, said he rushed through 40 movies in the last few weeks to get through the remainder of his queue before the service ends. McEvoy has remained faithful to Netflix’s DVD service so he can keep watching Bollywood and obscure independent films not often found on streaming services.\n“I was basically watching them as soon as I got them, and then returning the discs as quickly as possible to get as many as I could,” said McEvoy, who has been using Netflix’s DVD-by-mail service since 2001, just three years after it launched.\n“I remember I was in high school when I first signed up for it, and the concept was so novel I had to really convince my dad that it was a legit service and not some sort of Internet scam,” said McEvoy, who uses an old Xbox 360 to play his Netflix DVDs. “Now I have friends who’ve seen my red Netflix envelopes arrive in the mail, and either didn’t remember what they were or couldn’t believe that I still got the DVDs in the mail.”\nSome other Netflix users stood by its DVD service not only for the selection but for added perks. Brandon Cordy, a 41-year-old graphic designer from Atlanta, previously told CNN he stuck with DVDs because many digital rentals don’t come with special features or audio commentaries.\nThere are other factors, too. Michael Inouye, an analyst at ABI Research, said some consumers may still not have access to reliable or fast enough broadband connections, or simply prefer physical media to digital, much in the way that some audio enthusiasts still purchase and collect CDs and records.\nFor Netflix, however, the offering has made less sense in recent years. “Our goal has always been to provide the best service for our members, but as the DVD business continues to shrink, that’s going to become increasingly difficult,” co-CEO Ted Sarandos wrote in a blog post in April.\nShutting down its DVD business could help Netflix better focus resources as it expands into new markets such as gaming as well as live and interactive content. Its DVD business has also declined significantly in recent years. In 2021, Netflix’s non-streaming revenue – mostly attributable to DVDs – amounted to 0.6% of its revenue, or just over $182 million.\nThe cost to operate its DVD business may also be a factor, especially as Netflix rethinks expenses broadly amid heightened streaming competition and broader economic uncertainty. “Moving plastic discs around costs far more money than streaming digital bits,” said Eric Schmitt, senior director analyst at Gartner Research. “Removing and replacing damaged and lost inventory are also cost considerations.”\nEven before Netflix announced the news, some longtime subscribers said they could see the writing on the wall.\n“The inventory of available titles, while still vast, had been contracting some over the years with some movies that were once available no longer being so,” Cordy said. “Turnaround times to get a new movie or movies also started to take longer, so I knew it was only a matter of time. But I didn’t want it to end if I could help it.”\nOther DVD subscribers were hoping for a happy ending. Bill Rouhana, the CEO of Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment – which owns DVD rental service Redbox – told The Hollywood Reporter in April he hoped to purchase Netflix’s DVD business. “I’d like to buy it… I wish Netflix would sell me that business instead of shutting it down,” he said. Redbox remains popular despite the shift in streaming, but took a hit during the pandemic because of the lack of new movies and TV shows to fill the boxes.\nA Netflix spokesperson told CNN it has no plans to sell the DVD business and will be recycling the majority of its DVDs through third-party companies that specialize in recycling digital and electronic media. It will also  donate some of its inventory to organizations focused on film and media.\nNetflix is also offering subscribers a “finale surprise” where they could opt-in to receive up to 10 DVDs selected at random from their queue.\nMcEvoy, who already subscribes to Disney+, Hulu, the Criterion channel and Mubi, said he’s now testing out other services such as Eros (Indian cinema) and Viki (Korean and Chinese films) for harder-to-find content. Still, he said, he’s “sad” to see Netflix’s DVD service depart.\n“I absolutely would not have been able to find all of those movies [I’ve watched] if not for the Netflix DVD service,” he said.",

    "content": "If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.\nFor the better part of a decade now, I’ve been checking in from time to time on whether Guy Ritchie’s 2015 spy caper The Man From U.N.C.L.E. was available for casual streaming. As a spy movie, I enjoyed it more than any James Bond or Jason Bourne film, or even any Mission: Impossible movie — Ethan Hunt’s big stunts and endless face-swapping are a good time in the theater, but they rarely stick with me long. The Man From U.N.C.L.E. has a particular form of ensemble energy none of those movies have. It’s also a film built around a few really specific, endlessly revisitable setpieces in the way that makes easy streaming access to it more of a draw than owning a copy. So I was psyched to see it finally hit Netflix on July 27 — except that now I have to figure out how I feel about Armie Hammer.\nTo recap: Ritchie’s The Man From U.N.C.L.E. reboots a 1960s TV show of the same name, and takes its visual style from ’60s thrillers, particularly when it comes to the sharp, striking costume designs. The plot has two 1960s spies — CIA agent Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) and KGB Agent Illya Kuryakin (Hammer) — first facing off in the field, then forced to work together to stop a nuclear threat. From the start, they despise each other. At one point, they wreck a dilapidated bathroom while fighting each other. Later, they confine the violence to verbal barbs. They’re absolute catty queens about this conflict: They insult each other’s countries, bodies, and brains, and they both sulk or squirm if the other one gets in a particularly apt zinger.\nPhoto: Daniel Smith, Warner Bros. Pictures/Everett Collection\nThere are women in this movie too — Alicia Vikander as Gaby, a state asset they both have to protect, and Elizabeth Debicki (recently memorable in Maxxxine) as the villain, a Nazi-sympathizing sociopath. Both of them do their best to contribute to the too-cool-for-school ’60s spy-antic atmosphere. Debicki has one particularly great, spy-movie-classic scene with Cavill as they try to outwit and out-seduce each other. Vikander has a harder row to hoe as a character mostly stuck in the victim/prize-to-win role, with a particularly dubious scene where she tries to seduce Kuryakin just to be a brat about being under his protection.\nBut they’re both still backdrops to the real show in The Man From U.N.C.L.E. — two chiseled, dangerous men exchanging nonstop one-liners about how much they hate each other, as they work to defeat a particularly sleek and stylish evil — and more importantly, as they work toward a heavily foreshadowed prisoners’ dilemma moment where one or both of them will have to choose whether to betray the other.\nI love everything about Cavill and Hammer’s performances, and about how they’re scripted in this movie, as equals in radically different modes, and as spy-movie paragons with just enough vulnerability under their masks. Ritchie and co-writer Lionel Wigram let Solo be a smirky, superior bastard until he sees what Kuryakin is capable of as an opponent, at which point he’s genuinely unnerved. They have an Legolas-and-Gimli pouty one-upmanship over who does stealth infiltration better, and who has better techniques or gear. Even in the inevitable Bond-derived capture-and-torture sequence, Solo falls grimly silent in the face of a monologuing baddie, and is obviously unnerved by the prospect of agony and death, instead of responding by laughing and quipping at his captor.\nI love this movie. But there’s the Armie Hammer problem.\nPhoto: Daniel Smith, Warner Bros. Pictures/Everett Collection\nWhen a movie star has a big public fall from grace, whether it’s deserved or not, there are easy ways to dodge ethical questions about continuing to consume their work: “Well, you have to separate the art from the artist.” Or “Boycotting their output would unfairly hurt all the other people who worked on this project.” Or “At most, he might get two cents from me streaming this movie, so… whatever.” I’ve never really been comfortable with any of those arguments, which all feel like evasions rather than decisions about how to engage with an artist’s real-world behavior.\nAnd I’m similarly uncomfortable with some aspects of the Hammer scandal. His career imploded in 2021 when a former partner posted on Instagram, revealing text messages he’d sent her about his violent sexual fantasies. Other exes soon came forward, accusing him of physical, mental, and sexual abuse and assault. A police investigation was opened, but charges were never pursued, due to lack of evidence. Hammer has maintained that fantasies are just fantasies, and that the horrifying events his ex-partners described did happen, but were part of negotiated, consensual BDSM scenes.\nI have complicated feelings about all of this, and they directly conflict with each other. There’s no easy way to reconcile my dislike of the kink-shaming and privacy violations in this case with my frustration over victim-blaming and the culture of disbelief around women who expose bad behavior in powerful men. Or my distaste for the prurient, gleefully jokey, endlessly self-righteous interest that the media and social-media users took in Hammer’s explicit, violent texts about breaking a partner’s bones and drinking her blood.\nI didn’t want this window into Armie Hammer’s head, or into his sex life. But I also don’t want to give him a free pass with a cavalier “Well, it’s a he-said-she-said situation.” I sympathize with the women who feel he used alcohol, drugs, money, fame, and charm to lure them into situations where consent was complicated and compromised. In situations involving people’s private relationships and especially their sex lives, I personally believe that any kind of objective truth is impossible to reach, because all the participants experienced the same events so differently. (A point the recent Best Picture nominee Anatomy of a Fall explores explicitly, and with a lot of fascinating nuance.)\nPhoto: Daniel Smith, Warner Bros. Pictures/Everett Collection\nMostly, in any case like this, I remind myself that I have no power to affect the outcome, and that no one needs another yammering voice in the mix, caping for a celebrity or for total strangers. I’m not on a jury. I am not being forced to have an opinion over who wronged who the most. And I recognize that while people (and the internet hordes in particular) love a black-and-white, good-vs.-evil narrative — like, for instance, The Man From U.N.C.L.E., in which jerky but heroic patriots team up to battle literal nuke-owning Nazis — the real world is almost never that simple.\nThe Armie Hammer question is a little more complicated right at this exact moment because he seems to be floating a trial balloon for a comeback. After a few years of near-invisibility, after he lost his representation and his existing contracts, he’s suddenly back in the news with a few extended interviews with carefully chosen interlocutors: Bill Maher and Piers Morgan, men that Hammer could absolutely count on to comfortingly pat his back and sympathize about “the unfairness of the woke mob,” accept his “Well, I barely carved my initial on her hip” deferral, and not actually question his version of the story. Man From U.N.C.L.E. finally hitting streaming after nearly 10 years, at the precise moment that Hammer emerges from hiding… the timing feels a little weird, to say the least.\nBut a Netflix premiere also seems far too minor to work as a test balloon to gauge how much people remember or care about the accusations against Hammer, beyond recalling the memes and the cannibal jokes. The interviews are much more significant — and given how much they center on Hammer downplaying all the accusations against him, they’re much more of a step toward a rehabilitation tour and a return to acting. He’s been saying all the required things from the Hollywood-comeback checklist — that he’s learned from the experience, that it did him good to lose his fame and fortune because it taught him who his real friends were and put his ego in check. He’s said the entire scandal was a net positive for him. I’d be very surprised, though, if that stopped him from returning to Hollywood if a second act becomes a possibility.\nImage: Warner Bros. Pictures/Everett Collection\nAfter just a few days on Netflix, The Man From U.N.C.L.E. is already on the Top 10 most-streamed films list. That’s no surprise — it happens with just about any major Hollywood action movie that hasn’t been available on one of the more popular streaming services. Watching it again will certainly remind people why Hammer was a star: He’s charismatic. He has solid comic timing. He excels at this kind of straight-man/stuffed-shirt role. And he brings an appealing sense of menace to certain kinds of characters — menace that may even be enhanced by all things we can’t unknow about him.\nBut as much as I love this movie, revisiting it is just yet another reminder of how thoroughly people tend to abuse power, fame, and money, and weaponize them against everyone else. And that’s just an exhausting thing to be reminded of every time we turn around, particularly in a country that so openly and slavishly worships all three of these things.\nI did rewatch one scene from The Man From U.N.C.L.E., this weekend, though — a standout sequence midway through the movie where Kuryakin gets himself in trouble, and Cavill’s character Solo, from a safe vantage point, sighs and sits and leisurely listens to music and consumes a stolen sandwich, all while deciding whether to help Hammer’s character out of the situation he’s put himself in. I’m right there with him, looking at Armie Hammer’s attempted comeback and trying to sort out whether I can return to his movies in good conscience. If only this wasn’t a choice we keep having to make for ourselves, again and again and again.",

    "content": "Netflix is getting another price increase. As part of the streamer’s third quarter earnings results, Netflix announced that starting today, users on its $9.99 per month Basic plan will now have to pay $11.99, and those paying $19.99 per month for Premium will have to pay $22.99. Netflix’s $6.99 ad-supported plan and $15.49 Standard tier will stay the same price.Netflix last raised its prices in January 2022 and it closed off access to the $9.99 Basic ad-free plan to new and relapsed users in July, forcing everyone to fork out more even if they only want to avoid ads.Prices for the Basic and Premium plans in the UK and France are going up as well, with the ad-supported and Standard plans remaining unchanged. In the UK, the Basic and Premium plans will cost £7.99 and £17.99, respectively, while customers in France will see the Basic plan move up to 10.99€ and the Premium plan cost 19.99€.“As we deliver more value to our members, we occasionally ask them to pay a bit more,” Netflix writes in its letter to shareholders. “Our starting price is extremely competitive with other streamers and at $6.99 per month in the US, for example, it’s much less than the average price of a single movie ticket.”Earlier this month, The Wall Street Journal reported the streamer would raise the cost of its subscription a “few months” after the Hollywood actors strike ends, and now it’s happened even though the actors are still striking. Last month, the Writers Guild of America ended its strike after reaching a deal with services like Netflix to provide streaming data, higher minimum pay, and better residuals.Over the past few months, Netflix says it added 8.76 million new subscribers, bringing the streamer’s global total to 247.15 million. In addition to its password-sharing crackdown “exceeding” expectations, Netflix also saw significant gains to its ad-supported plan, with membership increasing almost 70 percent quarter over quarter. Netflix says accounts on the cheapest tier now account for about 30 percent of all new sign-ups in the 12 countries where it’s offered.And since removing the Basic plan in the US, UK, and Italy “boosted adoption” of Netflix’s ads and Standard plans, the company announced that it will be making the same change in Germany, Spain, Japan, Mexico, Australia, and Brazil next week. It’s also planning to roll out new features for its ad-supported tier, which will include a way to download content starting next month. Netflix added better resolution and the ability to watch two streams at once to its ad-supported tier earlier this year.Netflix has a strong slate of content planned over the next month, with its first live sporting event, The Netflix Cup, airing on November 14th. Meanwhile, the service is also debuting its Squid Game reality show and Scott Pilgrim anime in November while also adding Across the Spider-Verse later this month.",

From its roots as a DVD rental service to its current dominance as a global streaming giant, Netflix has redefined how audiences engage with streaming content.\nIn this guide, we dissect Netflix’s business model, drawing essential insights that marketers need to know to develop their connected TV (CTV) strategies.\nFounded by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph as a mail-in DVD rental service, Netflix swiftly adapted to the digital age, launching its streaming service in 2007.\nBy 2017, Netflix was available in more than 190 countries worldwide, in 21 languages, and reaching 100 million subscribers.\nSince then, award-winning original content and forays into in-person events and gaming have helped fuel Netflix’s rise (and price hikes). Netflix has not only disrupted home entertainment, but also continues to shape the evolving streaming and digital video landscape.\nNetflix’s strategic approach to subscriptions, advertising, and partnerships remain pivotal in shaping its streaming industry dominance.\nAt Netflix’s core is a subscription-based model, offering a vast library of video content for a monthly fee. The evolution of Netflix’s subscription structure has been instrumental in its global outreach, adapting to diverse markets by offering tiered pricing options (ranging in the US from its ad-supported plan for $6.99 per month to the standard plan for $15.49 and premium for $22.99) as well as localized content. In summer 2023, Netflix discontinued its Basic tier for new subscribers in Canada, the US, and the UK and expanded that phaseout in 2024.\nNetflix’s US subscription revenues will reach $14.52 billion in 2024, up from $13.58 billion in 2023, per a December 2023 EMARKETER forecast. EMARKETER expects Netflix’s subscription OTT ad-free viewers to decline each year until the end of the forecast period, sliding 1.8% in 2024 and 0.3% in 2027, according to a February 2024 forecast. This dip is largely due to the lure of more affordable ad-supported subscription options. In fact, 32% of US adults are watching subscription video-on-demand services less because they are watching more on free streaming services, per a July 2023 Aluma Insights survey.\nA chart showing the share of US Netflix sign-ups by subscription plan type, February 2023 to September 2023.\nCompared with its streaming competitors, Netflix, which rolled out its ad-supported subscription plan in November 2022, was considered late to the game; yet it only took a year for the ad tier to amass 15 million global monthly active users. This foray into advertising opened up a lucrative revenue stream and a new avenue for advertisers to tap into Netflix’s massive audience.\nSince the release, Netflix has bolstered its appeal to advertisers, adding more ad length options, offering “elevated” measurement capabilities, and eventually integrating shoppable functionality such as QR codes to ad creative. These incentives are on top of Netflix’s decision to lower costs per thousand (CPMs) in August 2023. Although it still has the highest CPMs of the major ad-supported video-on-demand subscription services EMARKETER tracks, prices are normalizing, having reached $47.05 in Q4 2023.\nIn 2024, Netflix’s ad revenues per viewer will grow 33.7% YoY to $5.28, according to a March 2024 EMARKETER forecast.The company’s US ad revenues are set to almost reach $1 billion in 2024.A binge ad format rewards ad-supported viewers with an ad-free episode after they watch three consecutive episodes—a strategic move that aims to boost time spent. Netflix is considering adding advertising to its gaming content, which could open another revenue stream.\nNetflix’s strategic alliances and partnerships have played a pivotal role in expanding its content and global reach. Collaborations with acclaimed filmmakers, production houses, and international studios—including Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Partners and Spike Lee’s 40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks—have enriched its library, offering a diverse array of content that resonates with audiences across demographics.\nAdditionally, co-productions, licensing agreements, and distribution partnerships have also been key to broadening the platform’s content spectrum.\nNetflix hosted its first-ever live sports event, The Netflix Cup, in November 2023. In March 2024, Netflix debuted The Netflix Slam, where tennis Grand Slam champions Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz competed at the Michelob ULTRA Arena at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas.The last two years has seen Netflix build and acquire a number of video gaming studios in hopes of fortifying multimedia dominance. It will soon release games based on its popular intellectual properties, such as “Squid Game,” “Stranger Things,” and “Black Mirror” according to The Wall Street Journal. Netflix House destinations, scheduled to open in the US in 2025, are physical experiences located in former department stores in Dallas, TX and King of Prussia, PA. Building on past Netflix live experiences for Bridgerton, Money Heist, Stranger Things, Squid Game, and Netflix Bites, Netflix House will take it a step further by creating a venue to explore Netflix stories and characters year-round.\nIn 2024, there will be 179.4 million US Netflix viewers (or 52.5% of the population), per a February 2024 EMARKETER forecast. Millennials will make up the largest percentage of Netflix viewers, at 52.2 million (or 29.1% of the population).\nThis year, 13.0 million people in the US will be subscribers to Netflix’s ad-supported plan in 2024.\nTime spent versus ad spend on Netflix\nAn outlier among streaming companies, Netflix doesn’t rely very much on ad revenues as of January 2024, signaling a huge opportunity for the platform considering its extensive hold on viewer engagement. Despite generating only 2.5% of US CTV ad revenues in 2023, Netflix captured more than one-fifth of streaming time spent, per EMARKETER’s US CTV Time Spent vs. Ad Spending 2023 report.\nIts measured approach is deliberate. “We’re still in the crawl of the crawl, walk, run stage,” Netflix CFO Spencer Neumann said at a conference in September 2023. “We have to scale the reach of our ads tier.”\n“I think I’m super bullish and confident in the long-term opportunity of advertising as a big incremental revenue and profit contributor to the business, but we do have to build it over time,” Neumann said.\nActive US users will spend an average of 1 hour and four minutes per day with Netflix in 2024, according to EMARKETER’s June 2024 forecast.Netflix’s share of time spent will remain stable over the next couple of years, accounting in 2024 and 2025 for around 6.9% of total time spent with digital media and 8.4% of total time spent with TV and video.\nA chart showing the average time spent per day with select digital media platforms by active US users, 2024. (Subscribers only)\nThe “What We Watched: A Netflix Engagement Report,” released twice a year, provides a glimpse into global viewing preferences and highlights the most popular series and film titles, whether they are new, old, licensed, or original.\nIts latest version, with data from July 2023 to December 2023, covers more than 18,000 titles and nearly 100 billion hours viewed, and includes metrics per title, such as hours viewed, availability worldwide, and release date.\nThe viewing data underscores how Netflix’s licensing strategy is crucial to its bottom line, in addition to its ability to draw target audiences because of its position as a powerhouse platform—not solely because of its content offering.\nThe most viewed titles were “King the Land: Limited Series” (630.2 million hours), “ONE PIECE: Season 1” (541.9 million hours), and “Sex Education: Season 4” (374.7 million hours).Non-English stories generated nearly a third of all viewing.Around 45% of total watch time across Netflix’s titles were licensed, as well as 30% of the top 100, according to Puck and Variety.\nCharting Netflix in 2024 and beyond\nEven though Netflix’s ad-supported subscriber base is relatively modest, its extensive popularity as a streaming platform is enough to bank on the company’s potential as a top contender in ads. In fact, the collective streaming time spent with Hulu, Disney+, ESPN+, and Amazon Prime Video only marginally exceeds Netflix’s time spent by 11%.\nAs a growing number of consumers look to scale back on discretionary spending amid economic uncertainty, Netflix’s ad tiers are likely to see more uptake.\n59% of US consumers prefer to watch ads to save $4 to $5 per month, per Hub Entertainment Research. Nearly 40% of consumers preferred platforms that offered both ad-free and ad-supported tiers, showing their need for flexible payment plans based on their unique needs.\nThis article has been updated.
