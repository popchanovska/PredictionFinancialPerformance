    "content": "NewsRetailGet medications faster with drone delivery from Amazon PharmacyCustomers in College Station, Texas, can now get their medications delivered in 60 minutes or less via drone. Amazon Pharmacy customers have a new way to get the medications they need quickly and affordably. Customers in College Station, Texas, can now get their prescription medications dropped outside their door via Amazon’s drone delivery service within 60 minutes of placing their order—at no additional cost. Eligible Amazon Pharmacy customers can select “free drone delivery in less than 60 minutes” at checkout. A pharmacist will then ensure medications are loaded and transported to a customer’s home within the next hour. College Station residents selecting drone delivery will have access to more than 500 medications that treat common conditions, including flu, asthma, and pneumonia.Amazon Pharmacy customers with an urgent health care condition can also access Amazon Clinic—which offers virtual, 24/7 treatment for 35 conditions, including a newly launched cold and flu condition—or One Medical, a hybrid virtual and in-person primary care offering. Rapid access to care, paired with fast medication delivery, can improve treatment outcomes, while allowing the customer to stay in the comfort of their home.“We’re taught from the first days of medical school that there is a golden window that matters in clinical medicine,” said Dr. Vin Gupta, chief medical officer of Amazon Pharmacy. “That’s the time between when a patient feels unwell and when they’re able to get treatment. We’re working hard at Amazon to dramatically narrow the golden window from diagnosis to treatment, and drone delivery marks a significant step forward. Whether it’s an infectious disease or respiratory illness, early intervention can be critical to improving patient outcomes.”How Amazon drone delivery worksAmazon’s drones fly at an altitude of 40 to 120 meters—an airspace with minimal obstacles. The drone’s built-in sense-and-avoid technology uses sensors and cameras to navigate around people, pets, and power lines.Cameras on the drone feed into a neural network trained to identify objects. On arrival at the customer’s home, the drone slowly and safely lowers itself above a delivery marker. Computer vision will detect any structures or objects protruding from the ground—including people and animals—and check if they are interfering with the descent path. When the delivery zone is clear, the drone releases the package, rises back up to altitude, and returns to the delivery center. Customers pick up packages without any interaction with the drone.Amazon is one of only a handful of drone delivery companies to earn a Federal Aviation Administration air carrier certificate required to operate drones with advanced capabilities. Amazon’s drones have safely delivered hundreds of household items in College Station since December 2022.“Our drones fly over traffic, eliminating the excess time a customer’s package might spend in transit on the road,” said Calsee Hendrickson,director of product and program management at Prime Air. “That’s the beauty of drone delivery, and medications were the first thing our customers said they also want delivered quickly via drone. Speed and convenience top the wish list for health purchases.”A full-service pharmacy that delivers convenienceAmazon Pharmacy, a full-service pharmacy available on Amazon.com, offers fast delivery when you need it most. Prime members receive free two-day delivery on their first order of a medication, with the option to set up automatic monthly deliveries for medication refills. For acute health needs, Amazon Pharmacy currently offers Same-Day Delivery in Austin, Indianapolis, Miami, Phoenix, and Seattle. Amazon Pharmacy customers have 24/7 access to a pharmacist to discuss questions about their medications.“For decades, the customer experience has been to drive to a pharmacy with limited operating hours, stand in line, and have a public conversation about your health situation, or to wait five-to-10 days for traditional mail-order delivery,” said John Love, vice president of Amazon Pharmacy. “With Amazon Pharmacy, you can quickly get the medications you need—whether by drone or standard delivery—without having to miss soccer practice or leave work early.”Since its launch in late 2020, Amazon Pharmacy has focused on removing the hurdles that prevent customers from getting the care they need—including RxPass, which offers $5-per-month access to more than 50 generic medications, and automatic manufacturer-sponsored coupons that deliver instant savings on brand-name medications. Between 30 and 50% of Americans forego taking medications that would improve their health due to inconvenience and high drug costs.“We’re making the process of getting the acute and chronic medications customers need easier, faster, and more affordable,” said Love. “Rapid delivery changes the prescription delivery paradigm from days to minutes, and represents a dramatic improvement over what patients are used to.”FAQWhere will Amazon offer drone delivery of prescription medications?How do I prepare for drone delivery?Can I get other products delivered with my medications?Do I need to be a Prime member to use Amazon Pharmacy, Amazon Clinic, or One Medical?",

    "content": "Update April 30, 2024: Amazon Q Developer now generally available!\nToday, we are announcing the preview of Amazon Q, a new type of generative artificial intelligence (AI) powered assistant that is specifically for work and can be tailored to a customer’s business.\nAmazon Q brings a set of capabilities to support developers and IT professionals. Now you can use Amazon Q to get started building applications on AWS, research best practices, resolve errors, and get assistance in coding new features for your applications. For example, Amazon Q Code Transformation can perform Java application upgrades now, from version 8 and 11 to version 17.\nAmazon Q is available in multiple areas of AWS to provide quick access to answers and ideas wherever you work. Here’s a quick look at Amazon Q, including in integrated development environment (IDE):\nBuilding applications together with Amazon Q Application development is a journey. It involves a continuous cycle of researching, developing, deploying, optimizing, and maintaining. At each stage, there are many questions—from figuring out the right AWS services to use, to troubleshooting issues in the application code.\nTrained on 17 years of AWS knowledge and best practices, Amazon Q is designed to help you at each stage of development with a new experience for building applications on AWS. With Amazon Q, you minimize the time and effort you need to gain the knowledge required to answer AWS questions, explore new AWS capabilities, learn unfamiliar technologies, and architect solutions that fuel innovation.\nLet us show you some capabilities of Amazon Q.\n1. Conversational Q&A capability You can interact with the Amazon Q conversational Q&A capability to get started, learn new things, research best practices, and iterate on how to build applications on AWS without needing to shift focus away from the AWS console.\nTo start using this feature, you can select the Amazon Q icon on the right-hand side of the AWS Management Console.\nFor example, you can ask, “What are AWS serverless services to build serverless APIs?” Amazon Q provides concise explanations along with references you can use to follow up on your questions and validate the guidance. You can also use Amazon Q to follow up on and iterate your questions. Amazon Q will show more deep-dive answers for you with references.\nThere are times when we have questions for a use case with fairly specific requirements. With Amazon Q, you can elaborate on your use cases in more detail to provide context.\nFor example, you can ask Amazon Q, “I’m planning to create serverless APIs with 100k requests/day. Each request needs to lookup into the database. What are the best services for this workload?” Amazon Q responds with a list of AWS services you can use and tries to limit the answer results to those that are accurately referenceable and verified with best practices.\nHere is some additional information that you might want to note:\nAmazon Q conversational Q&A capability is currently in preview in all commercial AWS Regions.\nThis capability is integrated into the AWS Management Console, AWS Console Mobile Application, AWS Documentation, AWS websites, and Slack and Teams through AWS Chatbot, making it more convenient and easier to find what you need.\n2. Optimize Amazon EC2 instance selection Choosing the right Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance type for your workload can be challenging with all the options available. Amazon Q aims to make this easier by providing personalized recommendations.\nTo use this feature, you can ask Amazon Q, “Which instance families should I use to deploy a Web App Server for hosting an application?” This feature is also available when you choose to launch an instance in the Amazon EC2 console. In Instance type, you can select Get advice on instance type selection. This will show a dialog to define your requirements.\nYour requirements are automatically translated into a prompt on the Amazon Q chat panel. Amazon Q returns with a list of suggestions of EC2 instances that are suitable for your use cases. This capability helps you pick the right instance type and settings so your workloads will run smoothly and more cost-efficiently.\nThis capability to provide EC2 instance type recommendations based on your use case is available in preview in all commercial AWS Regions.\n3. Troubleshoot and solve errors directly in the console Amazon Q can also help you to solve errors for various AWS services directly in the console. With Amazon Q proposed solutions, you can avoid slow manual log checks or research.\nLet’s say that you have an AWS Lambda function that tries to interact with an Amazon DynamoDB table. But, for an unknown reason (yet), it fails to run. Now, with Amazon Q, you can troubleshoot and resolve this issue faster by selecting Troubleshoot with Amazon Q.\nAmazon Q provides concise analysis of the error which helps you to understand the root cause of the problem and the proposed resolution. With this information, you can follow the steps described by Amazon Q to fix the issue.\nIn just a few minutes, you will have the solution to solve your issues, saving significant time without disrupting your development workflow. The Amazon Q capability to help you troubleshoot errors in the console is available in preview in the US West (Oregon) for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon ECS, and AWS Lambda.\n4. Network troubleshooting assistance You can also ask Amazon Q to assist you in troubleshooting network connectivity issues caused by network misconfiguration in your current AWS account. For this capability, Amazon Q works with Amazon VPC Reachability Analyzer to check your connections and inspect your network configuration to identify potential issues.\nThis makes it easy to diagnose and resolve AWS networking problems, such as “Why can’t I SSH to my EC2 instance?” or “Why can’t I reach my web server from the Internet?” which you can ask Amazon Q.\nThen, on the response text, you can select preview experience here, which will provide explanations to help you to troubleshoot network connectivity-related issues.\nHere are a few things you need to know:\nThis capability is currently available in preview in the US East (N. Virginia).\n5. Integration and conversational capabilities within your IDEs As we mentioned, Amazon Q is also available in supported IDEs. This allows you to ask questions and get help within your IDE by chatting with Amazon Q or invoking actions by typing / in the chat box.\nTo get started, you need to install or update the latest AWS Toolkit and sign in to Amazon CodeWhisperer. Once you’re signed in to Amazon CodeWhisperer, it will automatically activate the Amazon Q conversational capability in the IDE. With Amazon Q enabled, you can now start chatting to get coding assistance.\nYou can ask Amazon Q to describe your source code file.\nFrom here, you can improve your application, for example, by integrating it with Amazon DynamoDB. You can ask Amazon Q, “Generate code to save data into DynamoDB table called save_data() accepting data parameter and return boolean status if the operation successfully runs.”\nOnce you’ve reviewed the generated code, you can do a manual copy and paste into the editor. You can also select Insert at cursor to place the generated code into the source code directly.\nThis feature makes it really easy to help you focus on building applications because you don’t have to leave your IDE to get answers and context-specific coding guidance. You can try the preview of this feature in Visual Studio Code and JetBrains IDEs.\n6. Feature development capability Another exciting feature that Amazon Q provides is guiding you interactively from idea to building new features within your IDE and Amazon CodeCatalyst. You can go from a natural language prompt to application features in minutes, with interactive step-by-step instructions and best practices, right from your IDE. With a prompt, Amazon Q will attempt to understand your application structure and break down your prompt into logical, atomic implementation steps.\nTo use this capability, you can start by invoking an action command /dev in Amazon Q and describe the task you need Amazon Q to process.\nThen, from here, you can review, collaborate and guide Amazon Q in the chat for specific areas that need to be implemented.\nAdditional capabilities to help you ship features faster with complete pull requests are available if you’re using Amazon CodeCatalyst. In Amazon CodeCatalyst, you can assign a new or an existing issue to Amazon Q, and it will process an end-to-end development workflow for you. Amazon Q will review the existing code, propose a solution approach, seek feedback from you on the approach, generate merge-ready code, and publish a pull request for review. All you need to do after is to review the proposed solutions from Amazon Q.\nThe following screenshots show a pull request created by Amazon Q in Amazon CodeCatalyst.\nHere are a couple of things that you should know:\nAmazon Q feature development capability is currently in preview in Visual Studio Code and Amazon CodeCatalyst\n7. Upgrade applications with Amazon Q Code Transformation With Amazon Q, you can now upgrade an entire application within a few hours by starting a guided code transformation. This capability, called Amazon Q Code Transformation, simplifies maintaining, migrating, and upgrading your existing applications.\nTo start, navigate to the CodeWhisperer section and then select Transform. Amazon Q Code Transformation automatically analyzes your existing codebase, generates a transformation plan, and completes the key transformation tasks suggested by the plan.\nSome additional information about this feature:\nAmazon Q Code Transformation is available in preview today in the AWS Toolkit for IntelliJ IDEA and the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code.\nTo use this capability, you need to have the Amazon CodeWhisperer Professional tier during the preview.\nDuring preview, you can can upgrade Java 8 and 11 applications to version 17, a Java Long-Term Support (LTS) release.\nGet started with Amazon Q today With Amazon Q, you have an AI expert by your side to answer questions, write code faster, troubleshoot issues, optimize workloads, and even help you code new features. These capabilities simplify every phase of building applications on AWS.\nAmazon Q lets you engage with AWS Support agents directly from the Q interface if additional assistance is required, eliminating any dead ends in the customer’s self-service experience. The integration with AWS Support is available in the console and will honor the entitlements of your AWS Support plan.\nAmazon Q main product page\nAmazon Q details for IT pros and developers\nGet started with Amazon Q\nRead more about Amazon Q\nIntroducing Amazon Q, a new generative AI-powered assistant (preview)\nImprove developer productivity with generative-AI powered Amazon Q in Amazon CodeCatalyst (preview)\nUpgrade your Java applications with Amazon Q Code Transformation (preview)\nNew generative AI features in Amazon Connect, including Amazon Q, facilitate improved contact center service\nNew Amazon Q in QuickSight uses generative AI assistance for quicker, easier data insights (preview)\nOn November 29, 2023, the screenshot that showed how to get recommendations for Amazon EC2 instances in Amazon Q was updated to reflect latest improvements in the product.",

    "content": "Update April 30, 2024: Amazon Q Business now generally available!\nToday, we are announcing Amazon Q, a new generative artificial intelligence- (AI)-powered assistant designed for work that can be tailored to your business. You can use Amazon Q to have conversations, solve problems, generate content, gain insights, and take action by connecting to your company’s information repositories, code, data, and enterprise systems. Amazon Q provides immediate, relevant information and advice to employees to streamline tasks, accelerate decision-making and problem-solving, and help spark creativity and innovation at work.\nAmazon Q offers user-based plans, so you get features, pricing, and options tailored to how you use the product. Amazon Q can adapt its interactions to each individual user based on the existing identities, roles, and permissions of your business. AWS never uses customers’ content from Amazon Q to train the underlying models. In other words, your company information remains secure and private.\nIn this post, I’ll give you a quick tour of how you can use Amazon Q for general business use.\nFor information on how developers and IT professionals can use Amazon Q, see: Amazon Q brings generative AI-powered assistance to IT pros and developers (preview)\nFor information on how business analysts can use Amazon Q in QuickSight, see: New Amazon Q in QuickSight uses generative AI assistance for quicker, easier data insights (preview)\nFor information on how contact center agents can use Amazon Q in Connect, see: New generative AI features in Amazon Connect, including Amazon Q, facilitate improved contact center service\nAmazon Q is your business expert Let’s look at a few examples of how Amazon Q can help business users complete tasks using simple natural language prompts. As a marketing manager, you could ask Amazon Q to transform a press release into a blog post, create a summary of the press release, or create an email draft based on the provided release. Amazon Q searches through your company content, which can include internal style guides, for example, to provide a response appropriate to your company’s brand standards. Then, you could ask Amazon Q to generate tailored social media prompts to promote your story through each of your social media channels. Later, you can ask Amazon Q to analyze the results of your campaign and summarize them for leadership reviews.\nIn the following example, I deployed Amazon Q with access to my AWS News Blog posts from 2023 and called the assistant “AWS Blog Expert.”\nComing back to my previous example, let’s assume I’m a marketing manager and want Amazon Q to help me create social media posts for recent company blog posts.\nI enter the following prompt: “Summarize the key insights from Antje’s recent AWS Weekly Roundup posts and craft a compelling social media post that not only highlights the most important points but also encourages engagement. Consider our target audience and aim for a tone that aligns with our brand identity. The social media post should be concise, informative, and enticing to encourage readers to click through and read the full articles. Please ensure the content is shareable and includes relevant hashtags for maximum visibility.”\nBehind the scenes, Amazon Q searches the documents in connected data sources and creates a relevant and detailed suggestion for a social media post based on my blog posts. Amazon Q also tells me which document was used to generate the answer. In this case, it is PDF file of the blog posts in question.\nAs an administrator, you can define the context for responses, restrict irrelevant topics, and configure whether to respond only using trusted company information or complement responses with knowledge from the underlying model. Restricting responses to trusted company information helps mitigate hallucinations, a common phenomenon where the underlying model generates responses that sound plausible but are based on misinterpreted or nonexistent data.\nAmazon Q provides fine-grained access controls that restrict responses to only using data or acting based on the employee’s level of access and provides citations and references to the original sources for fact-checking and traceability. You can choose among 40+ built-in connectors for popular data sources and enterprise systems, including Amazon S3, Google Drive, Microsoft SharePoint, Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Slack.\nHow to tailor Amazon Q to your business To tailor Amazon Q to your business, navigate to Amazon Q in the console, select Applications in the left menu, and choose Create application.\nThis starts the following workflow.\nStep 1. Create application. Provide an application name and create a new or select an existing AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service role that Amazon Q is allowed to assume. I call my application AWS-Blog-Expert. Then, choose Create.\nStep 2. Select retriever. A retriever pulls data from the index in real time during a conversation. You can choose between two options: use the Amazon Q native retriever or use an existing Amazon Kendra retriever. The native retriever can connect to the Amazon Q supported data sources. If you already use Amazon Kendra, you can select the existing Amazon Kendra retriever to connect the associated data sources to your Amazon Q application. I select the native retriever option. Then, choose Next.\nStep 3. Connect data sources. Amazon Q comes with built-in connectors for popular data sources and enterprise systems. For this demo, I choose Amazon S3 and configure the data source by pointing to my S3 bucket with the PDFs of my blog posts.\nOnce the data source sync is successfully complete and the retriever shows the accurate document count, you can preview the web experience and start a conversation. Note that the data source sync can take from a few minutes to a few hours, depending on the amount and size of data to index.\nYou can also connect plugins that manage access to enterprise systems, including ServiceNow, Jira, Salesforce, and Zendesk. Plugins enable Amazon Q to perform user-requested tasks, such as creating support tickets or analyzing sales forecasts.\nPreview and deploy web experience In the application overview, choose Preview web experience. This opens the web experience with the conversational interface to chat with the tailored Amazon Q AWS Blog Expert. In the final step, you deploy the Amazon Q web experience. You can integrate your SAML 2.0–compliant external identity provider (IdP) using IAM. Amazon Q can work with any IdP that’s compliant with SAML 2.0. Amazon Q uses service-initiated single sign-on (SSO) to authenticate users.\nJoin the preview Amazon Q is available today in preview in AWS Regions US East (N. Virginia) and US West (Oregon). Visit the product page to learn how Amazon Q can become your expert in your business.\nAlso, check out the Amazon Q Slack Gateway GitHub repository that shows how to make Amazon Q available to users as a Slack Bot application.\nAmazon Q main product page\nAmazon Q for general business use\nRead more about Amazon Q\nAmazon Q brings generative AI-powered assistance to IT pros and developers (preview)\nImprove developer productivity with generative-AI powered Amazon Q in Amazon CodeCatalyst (preview)\nUpgrade your Java applications with Amazon Q Code Transformation (preview)\nNew generative AI features in Amazon Connect, including Amazon Q, facilitate improved contact center service\nNew Amazon Q in QuickSight uses generative AI assistance for quicker, easier data insights (preview)",

    "content": "Representation matters. We track the representation of women and underrepresented communities because we know that diversity helps us build better teams that obsess over and better represent our global customer base.See below for a four-year trend of our global gender and U.S. race and ethnicity data as of December 31, 2023.At Amazon, we are a company of builders who bring varying backgrounds, ideas, and points of view to inventing on behalf of our customers. Our diverse perspectives come from many sources, including gender, race, age, national origin, sexual orientation, culture, education, and professional and life experience. However, we recognize that categorizing identity can be falsely limiting and miss important nuances within broader demographic categories. That is why we have implemented a new “plus” or “+” methodology designed to give our employees more choices to self-select one or more categories. This Self-ID process allows Amazon to gather more inclusive global data on race, gender, and other identities to help give us a more detailed picture of our workforce.In 2023, Amazon has updated reporting to include directly employed seasonal and temporary Field and Customer Support workers as well as all employees in the Audible, Twitch, and MGM subsidiaries. Additionally, reporting has been updated to reflect the distinct Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (NHOPI) category. Moving forward this group is reported separately from Native American/Alaskan.A review of 2023 compensation, including base pay, cash bonuses, and stock, shows women in the U.S. earned 99.9 cents and women globally earned 99.8 cents for every dollar men earned performing the same jobs. The review also shows that racial/ethnic minorities in the U.S. earned 1 dollar for every dollar white employees earned performing the same jobs.Note: Employees included in these data are those for whom gender, race, or ethnicity has been identified. Amazon recognizes gender is not binary. Historically underrepresented communities refer to Women, Black, Hispanic/Latino, Multiracial, and Indigenous peoples as groups whose representation in tech has been historically low.Amazon's EEO-1 consolidated reports:2023 (PDF)2022 (PDF)2021 (PDF) 2020 (PDF) 2019 (PDF)",

    "content": "Last year at this time, I shared my enthusiasm and optimism for Amazon’s future. Today, I have even more. The reasons are many, but start with the progress we’ve made in our financial results and customer experiences, and extend to our continued innovation and the remarkable opportunities in front of us.In 2023, Amazon’s total revenue grew 12% year-over-year (“YoY”) from $514B to $575B. By segment, North America revenue increased 12% YoY from $316B to $353B, International revenue grew 11% YoY from $118Bto $131B, and AWS revenue increased 13% YoY from $80B to $91B.Further, Amazon’s operating income and Free Cash Flow (“FCF”) dramatically improved. Operating income in 2023 improved 201% YoY from $12.2B (an operating margin of 2.4%) to $36.9B (an operating margin of 6.4%). Trailing Twelve Month FCF adjusted for equipment finance leases improved from -$12.8B in 2022 to $35.5B (up $48.3B).While we’ve made meaningful progress on our financial measures, what we’re most pleased about is the continued customer experience improvements across our businesses.In our Stores business, customers have enthusiastically responded to our relentless focus on selection, price, and convenience. We continue to have the broadest retail selection, with hundreds of millions of products available, tens of millions added last year alone, and several premium brands starting to list on Amazon (e.g. Coach, Victoria’s Secret, Pit Viper, Martha Stewart, Clinique, Lancôme, and Urban Decay).Being sharp on price is always important, but particularly in an uncertain economy, where customers are careful about how much they’re spending. As a result, in Q4 2023, we kicked off the holiday season with Prime Big Deal Days, an exclusive event for Prime members to provide an early start on holiday shopping. This was followed by our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event, open to all customers, that became our largest revenue event ever. For all of 2023, customers saved nearly $24B across millions of deals and coupons, almost 70% more than the prior year.We also continue to improve delivery speeds, breaking multiple company records. In 2023, Amazon delivered at the fastest speeds ever to Prime members, with more than 7 billion items arriving same or next day, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe. In the U.S., this result is the combination of two things. One is the benefit of regionalization, where we re-architected the network to store items closer to customers. The other is the expansion of same-day facilities, where in 2023, we increased the number of items delivered same day or overnight by nearly 70% YoY. As we get items to customers this fast, customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs more frequently, and we can see the results in various areas including how fast our everyday essentials business is growing (over 20% YoY in Q4 2023).Our regionalization efforts have also trimmed transportation distances, helping lower our cost to serve. In 2023, for the first time since 2018, we reduced our cost to serve on a per unit basis globally. In the U.S. alone, cost to serve was down by more than $0.45 per unit YoY. Decreasing cost to serve allows us both to invest in speed improvements and afford adding more selection at lower Average Selling Prices (“ASPs”). More selection at lower prices puts us in consideration for more purchases.As we look toward 2024 (and beyond), we’re not done lowering our cost to serve. We’ve challenged every closely held belief in our fulfillment network, and reevaluated every part of it, and found several areas where we believe we can lower costs even further while also delivering faster for customers. Our inbound fulfillment architecture and resulting inventory placement are areas of focus in 2024, and we have optimism there’s more upside for us.Internationally, we like the trajectory of our established countries, and see meaningful progress in our emerging geographies (e.g. India, Brazil, Australia, Mexico, Middle East, Africa, etc.) as they continue to expand selection and features, and move toward profitability (in Q4 2023, Mexico became our latest international Stores locale to turn profitable). We have high conviction that these new geographies will continue to grow and be profitable in the long run.Alongside our Stores business, Amazon’s Advertising progress remains strong, growing 24% YoY from $38B in 2022 to $47B in 2023, primarily driven by our sponsored ads. We’ve added Sponsored TV to this offering, a self-service solution for brands to create campaigns that can appear on up to 30+ streaming TV services, including Amazon Freevee and Twitch, and have no minimum spend. Recently, we’ve expanded our streaming TV advertising by introducing ads into Prime Video shows and movies, where brands can reach over 200 million monthly viewers in our most popular entertainment offerings, across hit movies and shows, award-winning Amazon MGM Originals, and live sports like Thursday Night Football. Streaming TV advertising is growing quickly and off to a strong start.Shifting to AWS, we started 2023 seeing substantial cost optimization, with most companies trying to save money in an uncertain economy. Much of this optimization was catalyzed by AWS helping customers use the cloud more efficiently and leverage more powerful, price-performant AWS capabilities like Graviton chips (our generalized CPU chips that provide ~40% better price-performance than other leading x86 processors), S3 Intelligent Tiering (a storage class that uses AI to detect objects accessed less frequently and store them in less expensive storage layers), and Savings Plans (which give customers lower prices in exchange for longer commitments). This work diminished short-term revenue, but was best for customers, much appreciated, and should bode well for customers and AWS longer-term. By the end of 2023, we saw cost optimization attenuating, new deals accelerating, customers renewing at larger commitments over longer time periods, and migrations growing again.The past year was also a significant delivery year for AWS. We announced our next generation of generalized CPU chips (Graviton4), which provides up to 30% better compute performance and 75% more memory bandwidth than its already-leading predecessor (Graviton3). We also announced AWS Trainium2 chips, which will deliver up to four times faster machine learning training for generative AI applications and three times more memory capacity than Trainium1. We continued expanding our AWS infrastructure footprint, now offering 105 Availability Zones within 33 geographic Regions globally, with six new Regions coming (Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and a second German region in Berlin). In Generative AI (“GenAI”), we added dozens of features to Amazon SageMaker to make it easier for developers to build new Foundation Models (“FMs”). We invented and delivered a new service (Amazon Bedrock) that lets companies leverage existing FMs to build GenAI applications. And, we launched the most capable coding assistant around in Amazon Q. Customers are excited about these capabilities, and we’re seeing significant traction in our GenAI offerings. (More on how we’re approaching GenAI and why we believe we’ll be successful later in the letter.)We’re also making progress on many of our newer business investments that have the potential to be important to customers and Amazon long-term. Touching on two of them:We have increasing conviction that Prime Video can be a large and profitable business on its own. This confidence is buoyed by the continued development of compelling, exclusive content (e.g. Thursday Night Football, Lord of the Rings, Reacher, The Boys, Citadel, Road House, etc.), Prime Video customers’ engagement with this content, growth in our marketplace programs (through our third-party Channels program, as well as the broad selection of shows and movies customers rent or buy), and the addition of advertising in Prime Video.In October, we hit a major milestone in our journey to commercialize Project Kuiper when we launched two end-to-end prototype satellites into space, and successfully validated all key systems and sub-systems—rare in an initial launch like this. Kuiper is our low Earth orbit satellite initiative that aims to provide broadband connectivity to the 400-500 million households who don’t have it today (as well as governments and enterprises seeking better connectivity and performance in more remote areas), and is a very large revenue opportunity for Amazon. We’re on track to launch our first production satellites in 2024. We’ve still got a long way to go, but are encouraged by our progress.Overall, 2023 was a strong year, and I’m grateful to our collective teams who delivered on behalf of customers. These results represent a lot of invention, collaboration, discipline, execution, and reimagination across Amazon. Yet, I think every one of us at Amazon believes that we have a long way to go, in every one of our businesses, before we exhaust how we can make customers’ lives better and easier, and there is considerable upside in each of the businesses in which we’re investing.In my annual letter over the last three years, I’ve tried to give shareholders more insight into how we’re thinking about the company, the businesses we’re pursuing, our future opportunities, and what makes us tick. We operate in a diverse number of market segments, but what ties Amazon together is our joint mission to make customers’ lives better and easier every day. This is true across every customer segment we serve (consumers, sellers, brands, developers, enterprises, and creators). At our best, we’re not just customer obsessed, but also inventive, thinking several years out, learning like crazy, scrappy, delivering quickly, and operating like the world’s biggest start-up.We spend enormous energy thinking about how to empower builders, inside and outside of our company. We characterize builders as people who like to invent. They like to dissect a customer experience, assess what’s wrong with it, and reinvent it. Builders tend not to be satisfied until the customer experience is perfect. This doesn’t hinder them from delivering improvements along the way, but it drives them to keep tinkering and iterating continually. While unafraid to invent from scratch, they have no hesitation about using high-quality, scalable, cost-effective components from others. What matters to builders is having the right tools to keep rapidly improving customer experiences.The best way we know how to do this is by building primitive services. Think of them as discrete, foundational building blocks that builders can weave together in whatever combination they desire. Here’s how we described primitives in our 2003 AWS Vision document:“Primitives are the raw parts or the most foundational-level building blocks for software developers. They’re indivisible (if they can be functionally split into two they must) and they do one thing really well. They’re meant to be used together rather than as solutions in and of themselves. And, we’ll build them for maximum developer flexibility. We won’t put a bunch of constraints on primitives to guard against developers hurting themselves.  Rather, we’ll optimize for developer freedom and innovation.”Of course, this concept of primitives can be applied to more than software development, but they’re especially relevant in technology. And, over the last 20 years, primitives have been at the heart of how we’ve innovated quickly.One of the many advantages to thinking in primitives is speed. Let me give you two counter examples that illustrate this point. First, we built a successful owned-inventory retail business in the early years at Amazon where we bought all our products from publishers, manufacturers, and distributors, stored them in our warehouses, and shipped them ourselves. Over time, we realized we could add broader selection and lower prices by allowing third-party sellers to list their offerings next to our own on our highly trafficked search and product detail pages. We’d built several core retail services (e.g. payments, search, ordering, browse, item management) that made trying different marketplace concepts simpler than if we didn’t have those components. A good set of primitives? Not really.It turns out that these core components were too jumbled together and not partitioned right. We learned this the hard way when we partnered with companies like Target in our Merchant.com business in the early 2000s. The concept was that target.com would use Amazon’s ecommerce components as the backbone of its website, and then customize however they wished. To enable this arrangement, we had to deliver those components as separable capabilities through application programming interfaces (“APIs”). This decoupling was far more difficult than anticipated because we’d built so many dependencies between these services as Amazon grew so quickly the first few years.This coupling was further highlighted by a heavyweight mechanism we used to operate called “NPI.” Any new initiative requiring work from multiple internal teams had to be reviewed by this NPI cabal where each team would communicate how many people-weeks their work would take. This bottleneck constrained what we accomplished, frustrated the heck out of us, and inspired us to eradicate it by refactoring these ecommerce components into true primitive services with well-documented, stable APIs that enabled our builders to use each other’s services without any coordination tax.In the middle of the Target and NPI challenges, we were contemplating building a new set of infrastructure technology services that would allow both Amazon to move more quickly and external developers to build anything they imagined. This set of services became known as AWS, and the above experiences convinced us that we should build a set of primitive services that could be composed together how anybody saw fit. At that time, most technology offerings were very feature-rich, and tried to solve multiple jobs simultaneously. As a result, they often didn’t do any one job that well.Our AWS primitive services were designed from the start to be different. They offered important, highly flexible, but focused functionality. For instance, our first major primitive was Amazon Simple Storage Service (“S3”) in March 2006 that aimed to provide highly secure object storage, at very high durability and availability, at Internet scale, and very low cost. In other words, be stellar at object storage. When we launched S3, developers were excited, and a bit mystified. It was a very useful primitive service, but they wondered, why just object storage? When we launched Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (“EC2”) in August 2006 and Amazon SimpleDB in 2007, people realized we were building a set of primitive infrastructure services that would allow them to build anything they could imagine, much faster, more cost-effectively, and without having to manage or lay out capital upfront for the datacenter or hardware. As AWS unveiled these building blocks over time (we now have over 240 at builders’ disposal—meaningfully more than any other provider), whole companies sprang up quickly on top of AWS (e.g. Airbnb, Dropbox, Instagram, Pinterest, Stripe, etc.), industries reinvented themselves on AWS (e.g. streaming with Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Fox, Paramount), and even critical government agencies switched to AWS (e.g. CIA, along with several other U.S. Intelligence agencies). But, one of the lesser-recognized beneficiaries was Amazon’s own consumer businesses, which innovated at dramatic speed across retail, advertising, devices (e.g. Alexa and Fire TV), Prime Video and Music, Amazon Go, Drones, and many other endeavors by leveraging the speed with which AWS let them build. Primitives, done well, rapidly accelerate builders’ ability to innovate.So, how do you build the right set of primitives?Pursuing primitives is not a guarantee of success. There are many you could build, and even more ways to combine them. But, a good compass is to pick real customer problems you’re trying to solve.Our logistics primitives are an instructive example. In Amazon’s early years, we built core capabilities around warehousing items, and then picking, packing, and shipping them quickly and reliably to customers. As we added third-party sellers to our marketplace, they frequently requested being able to use these same logistics capabilities. Because we’d built this initial set of logistics primitives, we were able to introduce Fulfillment by Amazon (“FBA”) in 2006, allowing sellers to use Amazon’s Fulfillment Network to store items, and then have us pick, pack, and ship them to customers, with the bonus of these products being available for fast, Prime delivery. This service has saved sellers substantial time and money (typically about 70% less expensive than doing themselves), and remains one of our most popular services. As more merchants began to operate their own direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) websites, many yearned to still use our fulfillment capabilities, while also accessing our payments and identity primitives to drive higher order conversion on their own websites (as Prime members have already shared this payment and identity information with Amazon). A couple years ago, we launched Buy with Prime to address this customer need. Prime members can check out quickly on DTC websites like they do on Amazon, and receive fast Prime shipping speeds on Buy with Prime items—increasing order conversion for merchants by ~25% vs. their default experience.As our Stores business has grown substantially, and our supply chain become more complex, we’ve had to develop a slew of capabilities in order to offer customers unmatched selection, at low prices, and with very fast delivery times. We’ve become adept at getting products from other countries to the U.S., clearing customs, and then shipping to storage facilities. Because we don’t have enough space in our shipping fulfillment centers to store all the inventory needed to maintain our desired in-stock levels, we’ve built a set of lower-cost, upstream warehouses solely optimized for storage (without sophisticated end-user, pick, pack, and ship functions). Having these two pools of inventory has prompted us to build algorithms predicting when we’ll run out of inventory in our shipping fulfillment centers and automatically replenishing from these upstream warehouses. And, in the last few years, our scale and available alternatives have forced us to build our own last mile delivery capability (roughly the size of UPS) to affordably serve the number of consumers and sellers wanting to use Amazon.We’ve solved these customer needs by building additional fulfillment primitives that both serve Amazon consumers better and address external sellers’ increasingly complex ecommerce activities. For instance, for sellers needing help importing products, we offer a Global Mile service that leverages our expertise here. To ship inventory from the border (or anywhere domestically) to our storage facilities, we enable sellers to use either our first-party Amazon Freight service or third-party freight partners via our Partnered Carrier Program. To store more inventory at lower cost to ensure higher in-stock rates and shorter delivery times, we’ve opened our upstream Amazon Warehousing and Distribution facilities to sellers (along with automated replenishment to our shipping fulfillment centers when needed). For those wanting to manage their own shipping, we’ve started allowing customers to use our last mile delivery network to deliver packages to their end-customers in a service called Amazon Shipping. And, for sellers who wish to use our fulfillment network as a central place to store inventory and ship items to customers regardless of where they ordered, we have a Multi-Channel Fulfillment service. These are all primitives that we’ve exposed to sellers.Building in primitives meaningfully expands your degrees of freedom. You can keep your primitives to yourself and build compelling features and capabilities on top of them to allow your customers and business to reap the benefits of rapid innovation. You can offer primitives to external customers as paid services (as we have with AWS and our more recent logistics offerings). Or, you can compose these primitives into external, paid applications as we have with FBA, Buy with Prime, or Supply Chain by Amazon (a recently released logistics service that integrates several of our logistics primitives). But, you’ve got options. You’re only constrained by the primitives you’ve built and your imagination.Take the new, same-day fulfillment facilities in our Stores business. They’re located in the largest metro areas around the U.S. (we currently have 58), house our top-moving 100,000 SKUs (but also cover millions of other SKUs that can be injected from nearby fulfillment centers into these same-day facilities), and streamline the time required to go from picking a customer’s order to being ready to ship to as little as 11 minutes. These facilities also constitute our lowest cost to serve in the network. The experience has been so positive for customers that we’re planning to double the number of these facilities.But, how else might we use this capability if we think of it as a core building block? We have a very large and growing grocery business in organic grocery (with Whole Foods Market) and non-perishable goods (e.g. consumables, canned goods, health and beauty products, etc.). We’ve been working hard on building a mass, physical store offering (Amazon Fresh) that offers a great perishable experience; however, what if we used our same-day facilities to enable customers to easily add milk, eggs, or other perishable items to any Amazon order and get same day? It might change how people think of splitting up their weekly grocery shopping, and make perishable shopping as convenient as non-perishable shopping already is.Or, take a service that some people have questioned, but that’s making substantial progress and we think of as a very valuable future primitive capability—our delivery drones (called Prime Air). Drones will eventually allow us to deliver packages to customers in less than an hour. It won’t start off being available for all sizes of packages and in all locations, but we believe it’ll be pervasive over time. Think about how the experience of ordering perishable items changes with sub-one-hour delivery?The same is true for Amazon Pharmacy. Need throat lozenges, Advil, an antibiotic, or some other medication? Same-day facilities already deliver many of these items within hours, and that will only get shorter as we launch Prime Air more expansively. Highly flexible building blocks can be composed across businesses and in new combinations that change what’s possible for customers.Being intentional about building primitives requires patience. Releasing the first couple primitive services can sometimes feel random to customers (or the public at large) before we’ve unveiled how these building blocks come together. I’ve mentioned AWS and S3 as an example, but our Health offering is another. In the last 10 years, we’ve tried several Health experiments across various teams—but they were not driven by our primitives approach. This changed in 2022 when we applied our primitives thinking to the enormous global healthcare problem and opportunity. We’ve now created several important building blocks to help transform the customer health experience: Acute Care (via Amazon Clinic), Primary Care (via One Medical), and a Pharmacy service to buy whatever medication a patient may need. Because of our growing success, Amazon customers are now asking us to help them with all kinds of wellness and nutrition opportunities—which can be partially unlocked with some of our existing grocery building blocks, including Whole Foods Market or Amazon Fresh.As a builder, it’s hard to wait for these building blocks to be built versus just combining a bunch of components together to solve a specific problem. The latter can be faster, but almost always slows you down in the future. We’ve seen this temptation in our robotics efforts in our fulfillment network. There are dozens of processes we seek to automate to improve safety, productivity, and cost. Some of the biggest opportunities require invention in domains such as storage automation, manipulation, sortation, mobility of large cages across long distances, and automatic identification of items. Many teams would skip right to the complex solution, baking in “just enough” of these disciplines to make a concerted solution work, but which doesn’t solve much more, can’t easily be evolved as new requirements emerge, and that can’t be reused for other initiatives needing many of the same components. However, when you think in primitives, like our Robotics team does, you prioritize the building blocks, picking important initiatives that can benefit from each of these primitives, but which build the tool chest to compose more freely (and quickly) for future and complex needs. Our Robotics team has built primitives in each of the above domains that will be lynchpins in our next set of automation, which includes multi-floor storage, trailer loading and unloading, large pallet mobility, and more flexible sortation across our outbound processes (including in vehicles). The team is also building a set of foundation AI models to better identify products in complex environments, optimize the movement of our growing robotic fleet, and better manage the bottlenecks in our facilities.Sometimes, people ask us “what’s your next pillar? You have Marketplace, Prime, and AWS, what’s next?” This, of course, is a thought-provoking question. However, a question people never ask, and might be even more interesting is what’s the next set of primitives you’re building that enables breakthrough customer experiences? If you asked me today, I’d lead with Generative AI (“GenAI”).Much of the early public attention has focused on GenAI applications, with the remarkable 2022 launch of ChatGPT. But, to our “primitive” way of thinking, there are three distinct layers in the GenAI stack, each of which is gigantic, and each of which we’re deeply investing.The bottom layeris for developers and companies wanting to build foundation models (“FMs”).The primary primitives are the compute required to train models and generate inferences (or predictions), and the software that makes it easier to build these models. Starting with compute, the key is the chip inside it. To date, virtually all the leading FMs have been trained on Nvidia chips, and we continue to offer the broadest collection of Nvidia instances of any provider. That said, supply has been scarce and cost remains an issue as customers scale their models and applications. Customers have asked us to push the envelope on price-performance for AI chips, just as we have with Graviton for generalized CPU chips. As a result, we’ve built custom AI training chips (named Trainium) and inference chips (named Inferentia). In 2023, we announced second versions of our Trainium and Inferentia chips, which are both meaningfully more price-performant than their first versions and other alternatives. This past fall, leading FM-maker, Anthropic, announced it would use Trainium and Inferentia to build, train, and deploy its future FMs. We already have several customers using our AI chips, including Anthropic, Airbnb, Hugging Face, Qualtrics, Ricoh, and Snap.Customers building their own FM must tackle several challenges in getting a model into production. Getting data organized and fine-tuned, building scalable and efficient training infrastructure, and then deploying models at scale in a low latency, cost-efficient manner is hard. It’s why we’ve built Amazon SageMaker, a managed, end-to-end service that’s been a game changer for developers in preparing their data for AI, managing experiments, training models faster (e.g. Perplexity AI trains models 40% faster in SageMaker), lowering inference latency (e.g. Workday has reduced inference latency by 80% with SageMaker), and improving developer productivity (e.g. NatWest reduced its time-to-value for AI from 12-18 months to under seven months using SageMaker).The middle layer is for customers seeking to leverage an existing FM, customize it with their own data, and leverage a leading cloud provider’s security and features to build a GenAI application—all as a managed service. Amazon Bedrock invented this layer and provides customers with the easiest way to build and scale GenAI applications with the broadest selection of first- and third-party FMs, as well as leading ease-of-use capabilities that allow GenAI builders to get higher quality model outputs more quickly. Bedrock is off to a very strong start with tens of thousands of active customers after just a few months. The team continues to iterate rapidly on Bedrock, recently delivering Guardrails (to safeguard what questions applications will answer), Knowledge Bases (to expand models’ knowledge base with Retrieval Augmented Generation—or RAG—and real-time queries), Agents (to complete multi-step tasks), and Fine-Tuning (to keep teaching and refining models), all of which improve customers’ application quality. We also just added new models from Anthropic (their newly-released Claude 3 is the best performing large language model in the world), Meta (with Llama 2), Mistral, Stability AI, Cohere, and our own Amazon Titan family of FMs. What customers have learned at this early stage of GenAI is that there’s meaningful iteration required to build a production GenAI application with the requisite enterprise quality at the cost and latency needed. Customers don’t want only one model. They want access to various models and model sizes for different types of applications. Customers want a service that makes this experimenting and iterating simple, and this is what Bedrock does, which is why customers are so excited about it. Customers using Bedrock already include ADP, Amdocs, Bridgewater Associates, Broadridge, Clariant, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Delta Air Lines, Druva, Genesys, Genomics England, GoDaddy, Intuit, KT, Lonely Planet, LexisNexis, Netsmart, Perplexity AI, Pfizer, PGA TOUR, Ricoh, Rocket Companies, and Siemens.The top layer of this stack is the application layer. We’re building a substantial number of GenAI applications across every Amazon consumer business. These range from Rufus (our new, AI-powered shopping assistant), to an even more intelligent and capable Alexa, to advertising capabilities (making it simple with natural language prompts to generate, customize, and edit high-quality images, advertising copy, and videos), to customer and seller service productivity apps, to dozens of others. We’re also building several apps in AWS, including arguably the most compelling early GenAI use case—a coding companion. We recently launched Amazon Q, an expert on AWS that writes, debugs, tests, and implements code, while also doing transformations (like moving from an old version of Java to a new one), and querying customers’ various data repositories (e.g. Intranets, wikis, Salesforce, Amazon S3, ServiceNow, Slack, Atlassian, etc.) to answer questions, summarize data, carry on coherent conversation, and take action. Q is the most capable work assistant available today and evolving fast.While we’re building a substantial number of GenAI applications ourselves, the vast majority will ultimately be built by other companies. However, what we’re building in AWS is not just a compelling app or foundation model. These AWS services, at all three layers of the stack, comprise a set of primitives that democratize this next seminal phase of AI, and will empower internal and external builders to transform virtually every customer experience that we know (and invent altogether new ones as well). We’re optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS.(By the way, don’t underestimate the importance of security in GenAI. Customers’ AI models contain some of their most sensitive data. AWS and its partners offer the strongest security capabilities and track record in the world; and as a result, more and more customers want to run their GenAI on AWS.)Recently, I was asked a provocative question—how does Amazon remain resilient? While simple in its wording, it’s profound because it gets to the heart of our success to date as well as for the future. The answer lies in our discipline around deeply held principles: 1/ hiring builders who are motivated to continually improve and expand what’s possible; 2/ solving real customer challenges, rather than what we think may be interesting technology; 3/ building in primitives so that we can innovate and experiment at the highest rate; 4/ not wasting time trying to fight gravity (spoiler alert: you always lose)—when we discover technology that enables better customer experiences, we embrace it; 5/ accepting and learning from failed experiments—actually becoming more energized to try again, with new knowledge to employ.Today, we continue to operate in times of unprecedented change that come with unusual opportunities for growth across the areas in which we operate. For instance, while we have a nearly $500B consumer business, about 80% of the worldwide retail market segment still resides in physical stores. Similarly, with a cloud computing business at nearly a $100B revenue run rate, more than 85% of the global IT spend is still on-premises. These businesses will keep shifting online and into the cloud. In Media and Advertising, content will continue to migrate from linear formats to streaming. Globally, hundreds of millions of people who don’t have adequate broadband access will gain that connectivity in the next few years. Last but certainly not least, Generative AI may be the largest technology transformation since the cloud (which itself, is still in the early stages), and perhaps since the Internet. Unlike the mass modernization of on-premises infrastructure to the cloud, where there’s work required to migrate, this GenAI revolution will be built from the start on top of the cloud. The amount of societal and business benefit from the solutions that will be possible will astound us all.There has never been a time in Amazon’s history where we’ve felt there is so much opportunity to make our customers’ lives better and easier. We’re incredibly excited about what’s possible, focused on inventing the future, and look forward to working together to make it so.Andy JassyPresident and Chief Executive OfficerAmazon.com, Inc.P.S. As we have always done, our original 1997 Shareholder Letter follows. What’s written there is as true today as it was in 1997.Amazon.com passed many milestones in 1997: by year-end, we had served more than 1.5 million customers, yielding 838% revenue growth to $147.8 million, and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry.But this is Day 1 for the Internet and, if we execute well, for Amazon.com. Today, online commerce saves customers money and precious time. Tomorrow, through personalization, online commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery. Amazon.com uses the Internet to create real value for its customers and, by doing so, hopes to create an enduring franchise, even in established and large markets.We have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity and as customers, new to purchasing online, are receptive to forming new relationships. The competitive landscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace. Many large players have moved online with credible offerings and have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness, traffic, and sales. Our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities in other areas. We see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting. This strategy is not without risk: it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders.It’s All About the Long TermWe believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term. This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position. The stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital.Our decisions have consistently reflected this focus. We first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our brand. We have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise.Because of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies. Accordingly, we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision-making approach so that you, our shareholders, may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy:We will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers.We will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations rather than short-term profitability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions.We will continue to measure our programs and the effectiveness of our investments analytically, to jettison those that do not provide acceptable returns, and to step up our investment in those that work best. We will continue to learn from both our successes and our failures.We will make bold rather than timid investment decisions where we see a sufficient probability of gaining market leadership advantages. Some of these investments will pay off, others will not, and we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case.When forced to choose between optimizing the appearance of our GAAP accounting and maximizing the present value of future cash flows, we’ll take the cash flows.We will share our strategic thought processes with you when we make bold choices (to the extent competitive pressures allow), so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rational long-term leadership investments.We will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture. We understand the importance of continually reinforcing a cost-conscious culture, particularly in a business incurring net losses.We will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long-term profitability and capital management. At this stage, we choose to prioritize growth because we believe that scale is central to achieving the potential of our business model.We will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees, and continue to weight their compensation to stock options rather than cash. We know our success will be largely affected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base, each of whom must think like, and therefore must actually be, an owner.We aren’t so bold as to claim that the above is the “right” investment philosophy, but it’s ours, and we would be remiss if we weren’t clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take.With this foundation, we would like to turn to a review of our business focus, our progress in 1997, and our outlook for the future.From the beginning, our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value. We realized that the Web was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simply could not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection than was possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy- to-search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offer customers gift certificates, 1-Click shopping℠, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and recommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leader in online bookselling.By many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997:Sales grew from $15.7 million in 1996 to $147.8 million – an 838% increase.Cumulative customer accounts grew from 180,000 to 1,510,000 – a 738% increase.The percentage of orders from repeat customers grew from over 46% in the fourth quarter of 1996 to over 58% in the same period in 1997.In terms of audience reach, per Media Metrix, our Web site went from a rank of 90th to within the top 20.We established long-term relationships with many important strategic partners, including America Online, Yahoo!, Excite, Netscape, GeoCities, AltaVista, @Home, and Prodigy.During 1997, we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased traffic, sales, and service levels:Amazon.com’s employee base grew from 158 to 614, and we significantly strengthened our management team.Distribution center capacity grew from 50,000 to 285,000 square feet, including a 70% expansion of our Seattle facilities and the launch of our second distribution center in Delaware in November.Inventories rose to over 200,000 titles at year-end, enabling us to improve availability for our customers.Our cash and investment balances at year-end were $125 million, thanks to our initial public offering in May 1997 and our $75 million loan, affording us substantial strategic flexibility.The past year’s success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in being a part of this team. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the single most important element of Amazon.com’s success.It’s not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, “You can work long, hard, or smart, but at Amazon.com you can’t choose two out of three”), but we are working to build something important, something that matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren’t meant to be easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion build Amazon.com.We are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet commerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base. This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience, selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time we believe that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities to better serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience. To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but in prioritizing our investments.We now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have so much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. The challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several: aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks of product and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity. However, as we’ve long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove to be a very large market, and it’s likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good about what we’ve done, and even more excited about what we want to do.1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.Jeffrey P. BezosFounder and Chief Executive OfficerAmazon.com, Inc.",

    "content": "Updated 6:33 PM GMT+2, July 18, 2024\nNEW YORK (AP) — Amazon saw record sales for Prime Day this week as Prime members purchased more items than ever before, the company announced Thursday.The Seattle e-commerce giant, which does not disclose how much it earns during the popular discount event, also said “millions” of customers joined Prime in the past three weeks to take advantage of the discount event, which ended right before midnight Pacific Standard Time on Thursday. “Prime Day 2024 was a huge success thanks to the millions of Prime members globally who turned to Amazon for fantastic deals,” Doug Herrington, an Amazon executive who leads the company’s Prime and online shopping business, said in a statement included in the announcement. Data from some third-party groups also indicated shoppers spent more this year during the two-day event. Adobe Analytics, which tracks online sales, said consumers spent $14.2 billion on Tuesday and Wednesday, up 11% compared to last year.\nAdobe noted the growth was driven partly by back-to-school shopping with big spikes in spending for products such as backpacks, lunchboxes and other stationary supplies. Consumers also spent more on electronics and home appliances, it added.\nAdobe’s numbers are not adjusted for inflation. However, it said consumer spending this year has not been driven by higher prices, but new demand. It pointed to its own data, which shows online prices have fallen for 22 months and were down 4.2% year-over-year in June.Last week, the Labor Department reported overall consumer prices declined 0.1% from May to June after having remained flat the previous month.",

    "content": "One of Amazon’s most familiar consumer devices has been reinvented by AWS for the enterprise.At first glance, it may look like a Fire TV Cube, but the new Amazon WorkSpaces Thin Client is not for spending time watching Thursday Night Football or bingeing Invincible. As the name suggests, it’s intended for enterprise workers to reduce an employer's technology costs and provide enhanced security.For a significant portion of the workforce, some form of remote and hybrid work is here to stay, particularly in industries such as customer service, technical support, and health care. Enabling people to work in this way, securely and at the scale large enterprises require, poses real challenges. Employees need quick, reliable access to a variety of business applications and data—regardless of where they are working. Enter the Amazon WorkSpaces Thin Client.For the first time, AWS adapted a consumer device into an external hardware product for AWS customers. Melissa Stein, director of product for End User Computing at AWS, oversaw the Amazon WorkSpaces Thin Client project.\"Customers told us they needed a lower-cost device, especially in high-turnover environments, like call centers or payment processing,\" said Stein. \"We looked for options and found that the hardware we used for the Amazon Fire TV Cube provided all the resources customers needed to access their cloud-based virtual desktops. So, we built an entirely new software stack for that device, and since we didn't have to design and build new hardware, we’re passing those savings along to customers.”In computing, a “thin client” often refers to a simple hardware device optimized for the cloud—in this case, the AWS Cloud. By offloading processing power to the cloud, thin clients can be designed as simple, low-cost devices without advanced hardware capabilities.Take a spin around the Amazon WorkSpaces Thin Client, and you’ll notice no visible differences from the Fire TV Cube. However, instead of connecting to your entertainment system, the USB and HDMI ports connect peripherals needed for productivity, such as dual monitors, mice, keyboards, cameras, headsets, and the like. Inside the device is where the similarities end. The Amazon WorkSpaces Thin Client haspurpose-built firmware and software; an operating system engineered for employees who need fast, simple, and secure access to applications in the cloud; and software that allows IT to remotely manage it.Every day, many customers already log in to virtual desktops based on AWS End User Computing services, like Amazon WorkSpaces, Amazon WorkSpaces Web, or Amazon AppStream. Most of those users access their virtual desktops over the internet using a laptop or desktop computer. But those devices typically cost employers $600–$1,200 each.Amazon WorkSpaces Thin Clients start at $195 per device and are sold through Amazon Business, Amazon’s business-to-business (B2B) marketplace. Companies can order pre-configured hardware and have it shipped quickly and securely to employees' homes or offices. This makes deploying virtual desktops at scale simple and secure. End users can attach peripheral devices, connect to their AWS virtual desktop, and be up and running in less than five minutes.“Simplicity was key, and it just works out of the box,” Stein said. “IT leaders can easily manage their entire organization’s device fleet centrally and typically have an employee up and running in a few minutes, compared to hours or days with traditional laptops and desktops.”Working backwards: How Amazon WorkSpaces Thin Client came aboutAt Amazon, working backwards from the customer and what they need is how new products and services come to life. Stein and her team began an in-depth journey interviewing AWS enterprise customers about their cost, security, and management concerns, especially those organizations distributing laptops, tablets, and other computing devices to employees at home and in large contact centers, customer service operations, hospitality, and other work environments. Think businesses that have an employee base from hundreds to tens of thousands who need access to a computing device.\"We kept hearing the same pain point from our customers,\" Stein said. \"’I’m tired of shipping employees expensive desktops and laptops, which can be challenging and expensive to recover if an employee leaves the company. Unless I can change the cost equation of the hardware itself and make it less expensive to buy and manage the devices, I’ll never get my IT spend under control.'”That's when the lightbulb went on.\"We have an entire division in our company that makes devices already,\" Stein said. “Combining the expertise from the Amazon Devices group with logistics from Amazon Business and the power of the AWS Cloud is a strong combination for customers.”Top security for the fleet of devicesAs with everything at AWS, building security into the Amazon WorkSpaces Thin Client devices was “job zero.” Because it is powered by the AWS Cloud, the device itself does not store data and only runs approved software centrally deployed by an IT administrator. This reduces vulnerabilities if a device is lost or an employee leaves the company and hangs onto their device, which Stein learned was a big issue for many AWS customers. With Amazon WorkSpaces Thin Client devices, all data remains secure in the cloud and the device contains no local data.Amazon WorkSpaces Thin Client also includes security at the hardware level through on-device hardware authentication and integration with persistent desktops (WorkSpaces), nonpersistent applications (Amazon AppStream), and secure browser-only access (WorkSpaces Web), which creates a secure connection to a user's desktop in the cloud. The AWS Management Console, which AWS customers are familiar with, also provides real-time visibility into whether the device is active and running the latest software, as well as enabling remote resets of the device or reassociating it with different profiles. This means no sensitive data is on the device when it is in transit to or from an employee's location, and it enables a company's IT team to keep close tabs on the entire Amazon WorkSpaces Thin Client fleet. Administrators can configure policies, permissions, and access controls for different groups across the organization, as well as control what apps are used on the devices. For workers in any industry with high end user computing costs and a distributed workforce, the Amazon WorkSpaces Thin Client provides a low-cost device that is shipped directly to employees and makes it easy to access a personalized virtual desktop and apps with a few clicks, increasing productivity and streamlining IT management.Built for the future of workAmazon WorkSpaces Thin Client is designed to work anywhere in this new era of end user enterprise computing. And while the idea of a thin client computer isn’t new, the combination of advances in technology driven by the cloud and the shifts in work culture make the timing of the Amazon WorkSpaces Thin Client ideal.“Applications are in the cloud, connectivity is there, and we want to be able to access our desktop from anywhere,” Stein said. “All at a time when customers are saying, ‘We really, really need to look at our overall cost equation.’”Amazon WorkSpaces Thin Client helps meet all of those needs. And with millions of remote task workers in the U.S. alone, the need has never been greater.",

    "content": "If you manage a contact center, then you know the critical role that agents play in helping your organization build customer trust and loyalty. Those of us who’ve reached out to a contact center know how important agents are with guiding through complex decisions and providing fast and accurate solutions where needed. This can take time, and if not done correctly, then it may lead to frustration.\nGenerative AI capabilities in Amazon Connect Today, we’re announcing that the existing artificial intelligence (AI) features of Amazon Connect now have generative AI capabilities that are powered by large language models (LLMs) available through Amazon Bedrock to transform how contact centers provide service to customers. LLMs are pre-trained on vast amounts of data, commonly known as foundation models (FMs), and they can understand and learn, generate text, engage in interactive conversations, answer questions, summarize dialogs and documents, and provide recommendations.\nAmazon Q in Connect: recommended responses and actions for faster customer support Organizations are in a state of constant change. To maintain a high level of performance that keeps up with these organizational changes, contact centers continuously onboard, train, and coach agents. Even with training and coaching, agents must often search through different sources of information, such as product guides and organization policies, to provide exceptional service to customers. This can increase customer wait times, lowering customer satisfaction and increasing contact center costs.\nAmazon Q in Connect, a generative AI-powered agent assistant that includes functionality formerly available as Amazon Connect Wisdom, understands customer intents and uses relevant sources of information to deliver accurate responses and actions for the agent to communicate and resolve unique customer needs, all in real-time. Try Amazon Q in Connect for no charge until March 1, 2024. The feature is easy to enable, and you can get started in the Amazon Connect console.\nAmazon Connect Contact Lens: generative post-contact summarization for increased productivity To improve customer interactions and make sure details are available for future reference, contact center managers rely on the notes that agents manually create after every customer interaction. These notes include details on how a customer issue was addressed, key moments of the conversation, and any pending follow-up items.\nAmazon Connect Contact Lens now provides generative AI-powered post-contact summarization, and enables contact center managers to more efficiently monitor and help improve contact quality and agent performance. For example, you can use summaries to track commitments made to customers and make sure of the prompt completion of follow-up actions. Moments after a customer interaction, Contact Lens now condenses the conversation into a concise and coherent summary.\nAmazon Lex in Amazon Connect: assisted slot resolution Using Amazon Lex, you can already build chatbots, virtual agents, and interactive voice response (IVR) which lets your customers schedule an appointment without speaking to a human agent. For example, “I need to change my travel reservation for myself and my two children,” might be difficult for a traditional bot to resolve to a numeric value (how many people are on the travel reservation?).\nWith the new assisted slot resolution feature, Amazon Lex can now resolve slot values in user utterances with great accuracy (for example, providing an answer to the previous question by providing a correct numeric value of three). This is powered by the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs which improve accuracy and provide a better customer experience. Learn about all the features of Amazon Lex, including the new generative AI-powered capabilities to help you build better self-service experiences.\nAmazon Connect Customer Profiles: quicker creation of unified customer profiles for personalized customer experiences Customers expect personalized customer service experiences. To provide this, contact centers need a comprehensive understanding of customers’ preferences, purchases, and interactions. To achieve that, contact center administrators create unified customer profiles by merging customer data from a number of applications. These applications each have different types of customer data stored in varied formats across a range of data stores. Stitching together data from these various data stores needs contact center administrators to understand their data and figure out how to organize and combine it into a unified format. To accomplish this, they spend weeks compiling unified customer profiles.\nStarting today, Amazon Connect Customer Profiles uses LLMs to shorten the time needed to create unified customer profiles. When contact center administrators add data sources such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Adobe Analytics, Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Zendesk, Customer Profiles analyze the data to understand what the data format and content represents and how the data relates to customers’ profiles. Then, Customer Profiles then automatically determines how to organize and combine data from different sources into complete, accurate profiles. With just a few steps, managers can review, make any necessary edits, and complete the setup of customer profiles.\nIn-app, web, and video capabilities in Amazon Connect As an organization, you want to provide great, easy-to-use, and convenient customer service. Earlier in this post I talked about self-service chatbots and how they help you with this. At times customers want to move beyond the chatbot, and beyond an audio conversation with the agent.\nAmazon Connect now has in-app, web, and video capabilities to help you deliver rich, personalized customer experiences. Using the fully-managed communication widget, and with a few lines of code, you can implement these capabilities on your web and mobile applications. This allows your customers to get support from a web or mobile application without ever having to leave the page. Video can be enabled by either the agent only, by the customer only, or by both agent and customer.\nAmazon Connect SMS: two-way SMS capabilities Almost everyone owns a mobile device and we love the flexibility of receiving text-based support on-the-go. Contact center leaders know this, and in the past have relied on disconnected, third-party solutions to provide two-way SMS to customers.\nAmazon Connect now has two-way SMS capabilities to enable contact center leaders to provide this flexibility. This improves customer satisfaction and increases agent productivity without costly integration with third-party solutions. SMS chat can be enabled using the same configuration, Amazon Connect agent workspace, and analytics as calls and chats.\nAmazon Q in Connect product page\nGetting started with Amazon Connect user guide\nAWS re:Post for Amazon Connect, or through your usual AWS support contacts",

    "content": "This morning, Andy Jassy, Adam Selipsky, and Matt Garman shared the following messages with our teams.A little over three years ago when Jeff announced my new role, one of my first jobs was to identify who’d take over and lead AWS. It was important to me that we had somebody who understood AWS, valued our culture, would provide strong continuity, and could keep growing the business. We had strong leaders in AWS, several of whom could lead the overall business in the long-term, but who’d benefit from a few more years gaining experience and learning under a more seasoned CEO.Adam Selipsky was one of the first VPs we hired in AWS back in 2005, and spent 11 years excellently leading AWS Sales, Marketing, and Support, before leaving to become the CEO of Tableau. I’ve always had a lot of respect for Adam, and we met several times to discuss the possibility of coming back to lead AWS. In those conversations, we agreed that if he accepted the role, he’d likely do it for a few years, and that one of the things he’d focus on during that time was helping prepare the next generation of leadership.We were fortunate that Adam agreed to step in and lead AWS, and has deftly led the business, while also developing his leadership team. Adam is now going to move onto his next challenge (after taking a well-deserved respite), and Matt Garman will become CEO of AWS, effective June 3rd.I’d like to thank Adam for everything he’s done to lead AWS over the past three years. He took over in the middle of the pandemic, which presented a wide array of leadership and business challenges. Under his direction, the team made the right long-term decision to help customers become more efficient in their spend, even if it meant less short-term revenue for AWS. Throughout, the team continued to invent and release new services at a rapid clip, including several impactful Generative AI services, such as Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Q. Adam leaves AWS in a strong position, having reached a $100 billion annual revenue run rate this past quarter, with YoY revenue accelerating again. And perhaps most importantly, AWS continues to lead on operational performance, security, reliability, and the overall breadth and depth of our services. I’m deeply appreciative of Adam’s leadership during this time, and for the entire team’s dedication to deliver for customers and the business.As some of you may know, Matt started at Amazon as a MBA intern during the summer of 2005, and joined the company full-time in 2006 as one of the first AWS product managers. Initially working across all of AWS, Matt helped create our first service level agreements, define new features, and create new pricing plans. He then became our first product manager for EC2, and led EC2 product management in its early, formative years. During that time, he also led the team that defined, launched, and operated EBS. Matt eventually became the general manager of all AWS Compute services in 2016, which he did for about four years. In 2020, after having been deeply involved in our product organization for 14 years, I asked Matt to move to the demand generation side of AWS to lead WW Sales, Marketing, Support, and Professional Services.Matt has an unusually strong set of skills and experiences for his new role. He’s very customer focused, a terrific product leader, inventive, a clever problem-solver, right a lot, has high standards and meaningful bias for action, and in the 18 years he’s been in AWS, he’s been one of the better learners I’ve encountered. Matt knows our customers and business as well as anybody in the world, and has senior leadership experience on both the product and demand generation sides. I’m excited to see Matt and his outstanding AWS leadership team continue to invent our future—it’s still such early days in AWS.Thank you again to Adam for his leadership, and please join me in congratulating Matt.Thank you Andy, I appreciate the kind words and your leadership during all these years together. I take this next step with truly mixed emotions; I have spent almost 15 combined years in AWS, and it has been a real privilege.I am so grateful for all that I’ve learned about technology, leadership, organization, and culture at Amazon. Helping all of our customers and partners to build has been an amazing experience. Above all, I am grateful for my many friendships here, and for such talented colleagues who have taught me so much, while providing such good cheer.Leading this amazing team and the AWS business is a big job, and I’m proud of all we’ve accomplished going from a start-up to where we are today. In the back of my head I thought there might be another chapter down the road at some point, but I never wanted to distract myself from what we are all working so hard to achieve. Given the state of the business and the leadership team, now is an appropriate moment for me to make this transition, and to take the opportunity to spend more time with family for a while, recharge a bit, and create some mental free space to reflect and consider the possibilities.Matt and the AWS leadership team are ready for this next big opportunity. I’m excited to see what they and you do next, because I know it will be impressive. The future is bright for AWS (and for Amazon). I wish you all the very best of luck on this adventure.Thanks Andy and Adam. Adam, I want to personally thank you for everything you have done for the company, for our customers, and for me. I have learned a ton from you over the years, and I know that the AWS business would not be where it is today without your contributions and leadership.Over the last 18 years I have been fortunate enough to get to work on many different aspects of the AWS business, but one constant has been the world class talent and the unwavering customer obsession of the people I have gotten to work with. I am more optimistic than I have ever been for the potential for innovation and growth ahead of us, and I look forward helping us move faster, invent more, and operate as one team to help our customers.For me, AWS is much more than just a business. We are a team of missionaries working passionately to help make our customers’ lives and businesses better every day. It has been a privilege to work alongside all of you for the past 18 years, and I am humbled for the opportunity to continue to do so in this new broader role. I’m excited to get started!There will naturally be some organizational adjustments that we will make as part of this transition, so look for details on those in the coming weeks. Also, I will be hosting a number of AWS Town Halls over the next month, and I look forward to connecting with more of you directly during those.",

    "content": "Posted On:  Apr 30, 2024\nToday, AWS announces the general availability of Amazon Q Business and the preview of Amazon Q Apps, a new Amazon Q Business capability. Amazon Q Business revolutionizes the way that employees interact with organizational knowledge and enterprise systems. It helps users get comprehensive answers to complex questions and take actions in a unified, intuitive web-based chat experience—all using an enterprise’s existing content, data, and systems. Amazon Q Business connects seamlessly to over 40 popular enterprise systems, including Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Microsoft 365, and Salesforce. It ensures that users access content securely with their existing credentials using single sign-on, according to their permissions, and enterprise-level access controls.\nAmazon Q Apps empowers organizational users to quickly turn their ideas into apps, all in a single step from their conversation with Amazon Q Business or by describing the app that they want to build in natural language. With Amazon Q Apps, users can effortlessly build, share, and customize apps on enterprise data to streamline tasks and boost individual and team productivity. Users can also publish apps to the admin-managed library and share them with their coworkers. Amazon Q Apps inherit user permissions, access controls, and enterprise guardrails from Amazon Q Business for secure sharing and adherence to data governance policies.\nAmazon Q Business is also introducing custom plugins. Admins can connect any third-party application with custom plugins so that employees can use natural language prompts to perform actions like submitting time-off requests and sending meeting invites directly through Amazon Q Business. Users can also search real-time data, such as employee time-off balances, scheduled meetings, and more.\nAmazon Q Business and Amazon Q Apps are available in the US East (N. Virginia) and US West (Oregon) AWS Regions.\nAWS support for Internet Explorer ends on 07/31/2022. Supported browsers are Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari.",

    "content": "The new Amazon WorkSpaces Thin Client improves end-user and IT staff productivity with cost-effective, secure, easy-to-manage access to virtual desktops. The devices are preconfigured and shipped directly to the end user, ready to deploy, connect, and use.\nThe Thin Client is a small cube that connects directly to a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and other USB peripherals such as headsets, microphones, and cameras. With the optional hub it can also drive a second monitor. The administrator can create environments that give users access to Amazon WorkSpaces, Amazon WorkSpaces Web, or Amazon AppStream 2.0, with multiple options for managing user identities and credentials using Active Directory.\nThin Clients in action As a very long-time user of Amazon WorkSpaces via a thin client, I am thrilled to be able to tell you about this device and the administrative service behind it. While my priority is the ease with which I can switch from client to client while maintaining my working context (running apps, browser tabs, and so forth), administrators will find it attractive for other reasons. For example:\nCost – The device itself is low cost ($195 in the United States), far less expensive than a laptop and the associated operating system. Because the working environments are centrally configured and administered, there’s less work to be done in the field, leading to further cost savings. Further, the devices are far simpler than laptops, with less parts to break, wear out, or replace.\nSecurity – The devices are shipped with a secure “secret” that is used to establish a trust relationship with the administrative service. There’s no data storage on the device, and it cannot host rogue apps that could attempt to exfiltrate data. It also helps to reduce risk of data leakage should a worker leave their job without returning their employer-supplied laptop.\nEase of Management – Administrators can easily create new environments for users or groups of users, distribute activation codes to them, and manage the environment via the AWS Management Console. They can set schedules for software updates and patches, verify compliance, and manage users over time.\nEase of Use – Users can unpack and connect the devices in minutes, enter their activation codes, log in to their virtual desktop environment, and start to work right away. They don’t have to take responsibility for installing software patches or updates, and can focus on their jobs.\nThere are lots of great use cases for these devices! First, there are situations where there’s a long-term need for regular access: call centers, task workers, training centers, and so forth. Second, there are other situations, where there’s a transient or short-term need for access: registration systems at large events, call centers stood up on a temporary basis for a special event or an emergency, disaster response, and the like. Given that some employees do not return laptops to their employers when they leave their job, providing them with inexpensive devices that do not have local storage makes a lot of sense.\nLet’s walk through the process of getting set up, first as an administrator and then as a user.\nGetting started as an administrator The first step is to order some devices and have them shipped to my users, along with any desired peripherals.\nNext, in my position as administrator, I open the Amazon WorkSpaces Thin Client Console, and click Get started:\nEach Amazon WorkSpaces Thin Client environment provides access to a specific virtual desktop service (WorkSpaces, WorkSpaces Web, or Amazon AppStream 2.0). I click Create environment to move ahead:\nI give my environment a name, indicate that I want patches applied automatically, and select WorkSpaces Web:\nNext, I click Create WorkSpaces Web portal and go through those steps (not shown, basically choosing a VPC and two or more subnets, a security group, and an optional Private Certificate Authority):\nI refresh, and my new portal is visible. I select it, enter a tag for tracking, and click Create environment:\nMy environment is ready right away. I keep a copy of the activation code (aci3a5yj) at hand to use later in the post:\nI am using AWS Identity Center as my identity provider. I already set up my first user, and assigned myself to the MyWebPortal app (the precise steps that you take to do this will vary depending on your choice of identity provider):\nFinally, as my last step in this process in my role as administrator, I share the activation code with my users (that would be me, in this case).\nGetting started as a user In my role as a user I return to my testing setup, power-on, go through a couple of quick steps to select my keyboard and connect to my home Wi-Fi, and enter my activation code:\nThen I sign in using my AWS Identity Center user name and password:\nAnd my WorkSpace is ready to use:\nAdministrator tools As an administrator, I can manage environments, devices, and device software updates from the Thin Client Console. For example, I can review the list of devices that I manage:\nThings to know Here are a couple of things that are important to know:\nRegions – The Thin Client Console is available in the US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Canada (Central), and Europe (Frankfurt, Ireland, London) Regions.\nDevice Sales – The Amazon WorkSpaces Thin Clients are available in the United States now, with availability in other countries in early 2024.\nPricing – Devices are priced at $195, or $280 with an optional hub that allows you to use a second monitor. There’s a $6 per month fee to manage, maintain, and monitor each device, and you also pay for the underlying virtual desktop service.",

The e-commerce giant will replace drugstore operator Walgreens Boots Alliance in the Dow before the open of trading on Monday, S&P Dow Jones Indices said Tuesday.The shift was prompted by Walmart’s decision to do a 3-to-1 stock split, which will reduce its stock’s weighting in the index. The Dow is a price-weighted index, so stocks that fetch higher prices are given more weight. Seattle-based Amazon will join the Dow on the same day that Walmart executes its stock split.“Reflecting the evolving nature of the American economy, this change will increase consumer retail exposure as well as other business areas in the DJIA,” S&P Dow Jones Indices said.Amazon’s entry into the Dow, Walgreens’ exit and Walmart’s stock split will cause a ripple effect on the weighting of the Dow stocks. Once the shift is completed, Amazon’s weight in the Dow will rank 17th out of the 30 stocks in the index. Walmart’s weighting will drop to 26 from 17. UnitedHealth Group will remain the most heavily weighted stock in the index.\nAlso before the start of trading on Monday, ride-sharing service Uber Technologies will be added to the Dow Jones Transportation Average, S&P Dow Jones Indices said.\nThe change help give the index exposure to the ride-sharing industry.\nSan Francisco-based Uber will take the spot now held by JetBlue Airways, whose low share price caused its weight in the index to drop to less than one-half of one percentage point.S&P Dow Jones Indices made the announcements after the closing bell. Amazon shares rose 1.4% in after-hours trading, while Uber’s stock picked up 1.1%.",

    "content": "In 2023, Americans spent a staggering $7.2 trillion on ecommerce, with almost half that figure flowing through a single company, Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). The digital behemoth has reshaped how we shop, as well as entire industries, supply chains, and consumer expectations. American spending on ecommerce rose a third from 2019 to 2023, and Amazon sales rose 13% in the first quarter of 2024 over the same quarter a year before, compared with 8% for U.S. ecommerce sales as a whole during the same period. As such, despite the efforts of retailers like Walmart Inc. (WMT) to cut in on the ecommerce market, Amazon continues its dominance, at least in the U.S.\nWelcome to the age of the \"Amazon effect.\" This describes the profound impact of ecommerce—spearheaded by Amazon—on traditional retail and beyond. It encompasses the shift toward online shopping, the demand for ultrafast shipping, and the expectation of endless product choices. For consumers of its products, it has meant unprecedented convenience and often lower prices. For retailers, it has sparked significant changes, frequently forcing a choice of adaptation or obsolescence. Despite lowering its carbon footprint in 2022 and 2023, for all of us, it's meant an increase in greenhouse emissions, with Amazon accounting for the emissions of about 10 million American homes.\nAs its influence grows and its reach extends into new sectors like healthcare, we'll examine Amazon's impact and what's expected in the years ahead in ecommerce.\nThe Amazon effect describes the changes to conventional physical retail locations caused by increased online shopping.Amazon is the biggest in terms of ecommerce sales, so the platform is often used as a metonymy for the shift to ecommerce overall.Online shopping provides convenience and wide selection, often at a reasonable price, yet the customer loses out on seeing and touching a product before buying.While Amazon dominates in the U.S., Alibaba is among the ecommerce giants that outsell Amazon overseas.\nAs online shopping increases, the gains for ecommerce businesses are coming at the expense of brick-and-mortar retail stores. An increasing number of shoppers have been turning to their screens instead of physical stores; online sales were about 11.2% of retail sales in the last quarter of 2019, the last one before a pandemic shifted many to online shopping. Ecommerce sales in the first full pandemic period of the second quarter of 2020 accounted for 16.4% of retail sales, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and it's been between 14.5% and almost 16% in the years since.\nAmazon.com, which debuted in 1994, has maintained its lead in U.S. online sales, becoming the poster child for this change and giving the Amazon effect its name. The Amazon effect is cited as the primary reason for the decline in brick-and-mortar store sales, which has often foreshadowed the stores' eventual closure. More than 4,600 stores, including those owned by major retailers, closed in 2023, an 80% increase from 2022.\nBeyond driving down the revenue of traditional retail stores, the Amazon effect has also led to significant changes in consumer shopping patterns. For instance, based on the convenience they experience from online shopping portals, today’s shopper expects a lot more variety when visiting retail stores. While reading the contents or specifications mentioned on a small-sized pack containing an electronic gadget or cashew nuts in a retail store may not be possible, the same product details can be easily accessed in large text on online shopping sites.\nIt's also changed where Americans are employed. Walmart Inc. has long been the number one employer, but the Amazon effect is discernible in the next three of the largest employers in the U.S.: Amazon (1.53 million employees as of mid-2024), FedEx Corporation (FDX, 529k employees), and United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS, 500k employees).\nAlibaba has about half the market share of ecommerce in China, and it looms large beyond it, with almost a quarter of the world's ecommerce sales, about double that of Amazon.\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Online Shopping\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Online Shopping\nShop from the comfort of your home.\nOnline portals offer convenience, such as automated subscriptions and recommendations.\nItems need to be shipped.\nNo chance to test or see a product in person before purchasing.\nThe carbon footprint of ecommerce\nThe need to drive to a store, pick out different items, and stand in line to buy them is eliminated with online shopping. Purchasing an item online is often cheaper than purchasing in a store, although this is not always the case.\nHowever, the technology powering these advantages comes with significant drawbacks. Ecommerce platforms use big data and AI to analyze shopping patterns and behaviors, creating personalized recommendations and offers. While this can be helpful, it often crosses into the unsettling. The personalization can feel invasive or just tacky: That vintage record player you bought as a gift has long since had the algorithm thinking you're a hipster vinyl enthusiast, flooding your recommendations with obscure folk recordings and vintage audio equipment that costs more than your car.\nThe trade-offs between online and physical retail are complex. When shopping online, customers can't interact with products before purchasing, which can lead to dissatisfaction or increased returns. To address this, some ecommerce platforms now offer hybrid solutions like online ordering with in-store pickup.\nThis creates an interesting dynamic where consumers may use physical stores to examine products but then purchase online at a lower cost. While beneficial for consumers, this \"showrooming\" phenomenon poses significant challenges for brick-and-mortar retailers, which bear the price of a physical presence without consistently securing the sale.\nAs ecommerce continues to grow, it's reshaping entire industries and local economies. Closing physical stores limits product interaction prospects and alters community landscapes. The big box stores had already put many mom-and-pop retail stores out of business a generation ago; the Amazon effect has helped shutter the rest in towns across the U.S. Balancing the convenience of ecommerce with privacy concerns, the value of physical retail experiences and broader economic impacts remains a crucial challenge for consumers, retailers, and policymakers alike.\nMost presume the emissions from ecommerce come from the myriad delivery trucks heading down residential streets at all times of the day. That is not the case: packaging accounts for 45% of the greenhouse gas emissions worldwide from ecommerce. Another 25% is just from returns.\nThe 2020 pandemic—during which people worldwide faced quarantines, stay-at-home orders, and travel bans—brought to light the importance of online shopping. For many, it became a necessity, as opposed to a luxury. As long as the internet exists, online shopping isn't going anywhere.\nHowever, brick-and-mortar stores remain a very important piece of the economy, with sales rising as the pandemic eased. Physical retailers had more than $7 trillion in revenue in 2023, with that number estimated to reach almost $9 trillion annually in 2026.\nStill, brick-and-mortar stores need to be ready to adapt as online shopping continues to gain ground. To draw customers to a physical location, stores often need to offer something that can't be delivered online. This could be an experience, or a feeling people get when they visit the location. Some malls offer theme parks and are becoming more focused on being a destination to entice people to spend the afternoon or evening at the mall.\nSome retail outlets have thrived despite the increase in online shopping. This is because they offer a unique or high-quality product that isn't sold by online retailers or can't be easily replicated into a cheap knock-off product (that others can sell online).\nOther retail chains have created a culture around their product and stores where people like to go and be seen going there. More brick-and-mortar operations will likely need to adopt these tactics to thrive as online shopping has more market share.\nWhat is the Amazon Effect on Prices?\nThe Amazon Effect has led to greater price flexibility. It's much easier to update the price of a product online than in a store so that prices can adjust more quickly. This has benefited consumers because they can find more products at the right prices.\nHow has Walmart Attempted To Eat Into Amazon's Dominance Online?\nWalmart has also invested heavily in its online platform and logistics network to improve delivery speed. In addition, Walmart introduced its own membership program, Walmart+, offering benefits like free shipping, fuel discounts, and no minimum order requirements, like Amazon Prime. The company has also focused on integrating its online and physical stores, offering services like curbside pickup and same-day delivery to improve the \"omnichannel\" shopping experience—a one-stop place for all your needs.\nWhat Impact Have Recent Moves By Chinese E-Tailers Into US Ecommerce Had on Amazon?\nChinese e-tailers, such as Shein and AliExpress, have significantly impacted the global ecommerce market by offering a wide range of products at highly competitive prices. Their strategy relies on using the same Chinese manufacturers that Amazon often uses for inexpensive goods, but with direct shipments that can reduce costs. They've also been able to quickly adapt to consumer trends and offer a vast inventory of goods that has attracted a large and growing customer base, particularly among price-sensitive shoppers. Temu, another Chinese e-tailer, has significantly impacted the market by using low production costs, efficient supply chains, and direct-to-consumer shipping models to keep prices exceptionally low.\nThe Amazon effect has fundamentally reshaped the retail landscape, extending beyond online shopping. The effect stands for the shifting standards for convenience, price competitiveness, and product variety, forcing traditional retailers to adapt or risk obsolescence. The effect has redefined customer expectations, making fast (often free) shipping and vast product selection the new norm.\nThe Amazon effect has also meant the closure of many brick-and-mortar stores, altering the fabric of local communities. The effect extends to labor markets, supply chains, and urban planning. As Amazon continues to expand into new sectors, its influence grows, raising important questions about market competition, data privacy, and the future of retail. But it faces competition, not just from Walmart but also from Chinese e-tailers with direct access to China's suppliers.",

    "content": "The US government and 17 states are suing Amazon in a landmark monopoly case reflecting years of allegations that the e-commerce giant abused its economic dominance and harmed fair competition.\nThe groundbreaking lawsuit by the Federal Trade Commission and 17 attorneys general marks the government’s sharpest attack yet against Amazon, a company that started off selling books on the internet but has since become known as “the everything store,” expanding into selling a vast range of consumer products, creating a globe-spanning logistics network and becoming a powerhouse in other technologies such as cloud computing.\nThe 172-page complaint alleges Amazon unfairly promotes its own platform and services at the expense of third-party sellers who rely on the company’s e-commerce marketplace for distribution.\nFor example, according to the FTC, Amazon has harmed competition by requiring sellers on its platform to purchase Amazon’s in-house logistics services in order to secure the best seller benefits, referred to as “Prime” eligibility. It also claims the company anticompetitively forces sellers to list their products on Amazon at the lowest prices anywhere on the web, instead of allowing sellers to offer their products at competing marketplaces for a lower price.\nThat practice is already the subject of a separate lawsuit targeting Amazon filed by California’s attorney general last year.\nBecause of Amazon’s dominance in e-commerce, sellers have little option but to accept Amazon’s terms, the FTC alleges, resulting in higher prices for consumers and a worse consumer experience. Amazon also ranks its own products in marketplace search results higher than those sold by third parties, the FTC said.\nAmazon is “squarely focused on preventing anyone else from gaining that same critical mass of customers,” FTC Chair Lina Khan told reporters Tuesday. “This complaint reflects the cutting edge and best thinking on how competition occurs in digital markets and, similarly, the tactics that Amazon has used to suffocate rivals, deprive them of oxygen, and really leave a stunted landscape in its wake.”\nThe states involved in the case are Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin.\nThe complaint was filed in the US District Court for the Western District of Washington, and seeks a court order blocking Amazon from engaging in the allegedly anticompetitive behavior.\nThe FTC isn’t ruling out a possible breakup of Amazon — nor the potential for individual executives to be named in a landmark antitrust case against the e-commerce giant, according to Khan.\nSpeaking Tuesday just hours after the lawsuit was filed, Khan declined to say that the FTC would specifically seek a breakup as a remedy to Amazon’s allegedly illegal monopoly.\n“At this stage, the complaint is really focused on the issue of liability,” Khan said at the event hosted by Bloomberg News in Washington.\nBut the agency’s complaint, filed in Seattle federal court, suggests that any court order to address the issue could include “structural relief,” a legal term referring to a potential breakup of Amazon.\nAsked about that request, Khan said the FTC is broadly interested in any relief that can effectively stop Amazon’s allegedly anticompetitive behavior.\n“Ultimately, you will want to make sure that any remedy is halting the illegal conduct, preventing a recurrence and ensuring that Amazon is not able to profit and benefit from its illegal behavior,” Khan said Tuesday afternoon. “When we get to the issue of remedy, those are going to be the principles we’ll be focused on.”\nKhan also left open the possibility that Amazon executives could be held personally liable if there is sufficient evidence of their responsibility for Amazon’s allegedly illegal conduct.\n“We want to make sure that we are bringing cases against the right defendants,” Khan said in response to a question from CNN about whether the FTC considered naming specific executives in Tuesday’s case. “If we think that there is a basis for doing so, we won’t hesitate to do that.”\nThe suit makes Amazon the third tech giant after Google and Meta to be hit with sweeping US government allegations that the company spent years violating federal antitrust laws, reflecting policymakers’ growing worldwide hostility toward Big Tech that intensified after 2016. The litigation could take years to play out. But just as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his spectacular wealth have inspired critics to draw comparisons to America’s Gilded Age, so may the FTC lawsuit come to symbolize a modern repeat of the antitrust crackdown of the early 20th century.\nIn a release, Khan accused Amazon of using “punitive and coercive tactics” to preserve an illegal monopoly.\n“Amazon is now exploiting its monopoly power to enrich itself while raising prices and degrading service for the tens of millions of American families who shop on its platform and the hundreds of thousands of businesses that rely on Amazon to reach them,” Khan said. “Today’s lawsuit seeks to hold Amazon to account for these monopolistic practices and restore the lost promise of free and fair competition.”\n“Today’s suit makes clear the FTC’s focus has radically departed from its mission of protecting consumers and competition,”said David Zapolsky, Amazon’s senior vice president of global public policy and general counsel. He said Amazon’s practices have helped spur competition, innovation and selection across the retail industry. He argued that Amazon has fostered lower prices, faster delivery and helped small businesses sell their goods.\n“If the FTC gets its way, the result would be fewer products to choose from, higher prices, slower deliveries for consumers, and reduced options for small businesses — the opposite of what antitrust law is designed to do,” he said. “The lawsuit filed by the FTC today is wrong on the facts and the law, and we look forward to making that case in court.”\nIn a subsequent blog post, Zapolsky warned that the FTC suit could not only force Amazon to list products at a higher price point than on rival marketplaces, but also that it could raise Amazon’s costs of doing business — costs that may then be passed along to consumers in the form of higher Amazon Prime subscription prices or slower shipping times.\n“We respect the role the FTC has historically played in protecting consumers and promoting competition,” the blog post said. “Unfortunately, it appears the current FTC is radically departing from that approach, filing a misguided lawsuit against Amazon that would, if successful, force Amazon to engage in practices that actually harm consumers and the many businesses that sell in our store—such as having to feature higher prices, offer slower or less reliable Prime shipping, and make Prime more expensive and less convenient.”\nFor years, Amazon’s critics including US lawmakers, European regulators, third-party sellers, consumer advocacy groups and more have accused the company of everything from mistreating its workers to forcing its third-party sellers to accept anticompetitive terms. Amazon has unfairly used sellers’ own commercial data against them, opponents have said, so it can figure out what products Amazon should sell itself. And the fact that Amazon competes with sellers on the very same marketplace it controls represents a conflict of interest that should be considered illegal, many of Amazon’s critics have said.\nBut Tuesday’s FTC suit is more narrowly focused, taking aim at Amazon’s behavior in two specific markets: an “online superstore” market, in which its conduct allegedly harmed shoppers; and an “online marketplace services” market serving independent sellers. Amazon’s deliberate self-preferencing of its own products in search results is an outgrowth of the underlying anticompetitive behavior at issue in the case, said John Newman, deputy director of the FTC’s competition bureau.\nThe lawsuit represents a watershed moment in Khan’s career. She is widely credited with kickstarting antitrust scrutiny of Amazon in the United States with a seminal law paper in 2017. She later helped lead a congressional investigation into the tech industry’s alleged competition abuses, detailing in a 450-page report how Amazon — as well as Apple, Google and Meta — enjoy “monopoly power” and that there is “significant evidence” to show that the companies’ anticompetitive conduct has hindered innovation, reduced consumer choice and weakened democracy.\nThe investigation led to a raft of legislative proposals aimed at reining in the companies, but the most significant ones have stalled under a barrage of industry lobbying and decisions by congressional leaders not to bring the bills up for a final vote.\nLawmakers’ inaction has left it to antitrust enforcers to police the tech industry’s alleged harms to competition. In 2021, President Joe Biden stunned many in Washington when he tapped Khan not only to serve on the FTC but to lead the agency, sending a signal that he supported tough antitrust oversight.\nSince then Khan has taken an aggressive enforcement posture, particularly toward the tech industry. Under her watch, the FTC has sued to block numerous tech acquisitions, most notably Microsoft’s $69 billion deal to acquire video game publisher Activision Blizzard. It has moved to restrict how companies may collect and use consumers’ personal information, and warned them of the risks of generative artificial intelligence.\nThroughout, the FTC has scrutinized Amazon — suing the company in June for allegedly tricking millions of consumers into signing up for Amazon Prime and reaching multimillion-dollar settlements in May with the company over alleged privacy violations linked to Amazon’s smart home devices.\nBut the latest suit against Amazon may rank as the most significant of all, because it drives at the heart of Amazon’s e-commerce business and focuses on some of the most persistent criticisms of the company.\nIn one heavily redacted portion of the FTC lawsuit, agency attorneys cryptically described Project Nessie, an “algorithm” and “pricing system” that has allegedly “extracted” an undisclosed amount of value “from American households.” It is unclear what Project Nessie is or how it works, but the FTC alleges in the complaint that the company’s program “belies its public claim that it ‘seek[s] to be Earth’s most customer-centric company.’” Amazon didn’t immediately respond to CNN’s questions about Project Nessie.\nIn a sign of how threatening Amazon perceived Khan’s ascent to be, the company in 2021 called for her recusal from all cases involving the tech giant.\nKhan has resisted those calls. And in remarks to reporters this week, Khan deflected questions about her past work on Amazon, praising the efforts of FTC staff in completing the agency’s investigation. On Tuesday, the FTC said it held a unanimous 3-0 vote authorizing the lawsuit; Khan was among those voting to proceed.",
