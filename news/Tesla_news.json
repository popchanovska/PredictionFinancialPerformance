    "content": "I'm an autos reporter who's driven plenty of EVs. My first experience with a Tesla was still eye-opening.\nAn icon in the shape of an angle pointing down.\nTesla Model 3 Hertz rental in my driveway\nDriving a Tesla is unlike any other experience I've had behind the wheel.The nearly buttonless interior was hard to get used to.I'm still not a fan of one-pedal driving.\nAccess your favorite topics in a personalized feed while you're on the go.\nIn the more than 10 years I've been covering the automotive industry, I've driven plenty of cars — electric, hybrid, and gas-powered.One of the perks of this job is having access to press fleets where I can try out all the cars I'm writing about every day. It gives me a better understanding of the evolution of technology and engineering in these cars as I cover this ever-changing industry.But Teslas have always been harder to come by. Elon Musk's electric car company doesn't have a traditional press fleet. I've only been in Teslas for short periods of time, either to drive as a comparison to something else or in a ride-along capacity at auto shows.Over the holidays, I decided it was finally time to get a Tesla in my driveway, and I rented a Model 3 from Hertz. Business Insider has reviewed the Model 3 before, but I would be going into this as a Tesla novice.Along the way, I found that much of my past experience didn't serve me in a Tesla. Musk's cars are a wholly unique experience, from the drive and feel of the car down to the way you can interact with the technology.Here's everything I learned from my five days with the Model 3.\nSuperchargers make a huge difference\nOne of my many stops at Tesla Superchargers during my five-day rental\nI've always known from data and talking to actual Tesla owners that the Supercharger network is a game-changer. But I was still shocked by how much quicker and easier it was to charge my Tesla than when I had an EV from a legacy automaker.The longest I spent at a charger was about an hour on my second day with the car to juice up from around 20% to 100% (I later learned it's better to charge to 80%, especially in cold temperatures, but the full charge didn't seem to negatively affect my experience).On the other hand, when I took a Chevrolet Bolt on a road trip in 2019, I spent hours upon hours at Level 2 chargers in rural areas and rarely ever filled the battery all the way.\nI probably would have had a better charing experience in warmer weather\nTesla Model 3 battery preconditioning notification\nI didn't have a great experience with the battery preconditioning option in the cold weather here in Michigan. I did use my Tesla to navigate to a Supercharger every time I needed to charge, which meant the car started warming up the battery en route to improve my charging experience.But all four times I charged my Tesla I got a warning on the touchscreen that my battery was cold and would charge more slowly.\nThe nearly button-less interior meant I had to think more about simple tasks\nInterior of Tesla Model 3 Hertz rental\nThere are some things that are so standardized in every other car I've driven that I didn't expect to be tripped up by in the Tesla. My first obstacle was the side-view mirrors. The Hertz employee who delivered the car was much taller than me (not hard to be), so the mirrors needed serious adjusting when I got in the car.The only problem was that when I looked in all the usual spots for the mirror toggles — on the driver's door, next to the steering column, in the center console — the usual buttons were nowhere to be found. I had to dig through some instructional material Hertz sent me to find the mirror settings on the touchscreen.\nI’m not a fan of one-pedal driving, but it does help around town\nTesla Model 3 trunk full of groceries\nIn all of my previous EV experiences, I have either turned off or turned down the regenerative braking system because I didn't like the jerky feeling when I would take my foot off the gas. I couldn't find any settings for one-pedal driving, so I decided to go all in on the experience.I'm still not a fan of the jerky nature of one-pedal driving, even once I got a better handle on slowly taking my foot off the gas to simulate the same coasting effect you get in a gas-powered car. On the highway, not being able to coast normally made for a less-than-smooth ride. I wouldn't recommend it for someone prone to car sickness.Still, it's nice to use for around-the-town driving once you get the hang of it, and I'm sure that my one-pedal driving saved me some range while I was running last-minute holiday errands.\nI didn’t know how to turn off the car\nThe only two buttons in the Tesla Model 3 are on the steering wheel.\nMost surprisingly, the first time I parked my Model 3, I quickly realized I wasn't actually sure how to turn off the car without a push button start or key. After toggling back through the settings menu I found when adjusting the mirrors, I was still stumped. So I whipped out my phone and literally Googled \"how to turn off Model 3.\" Turns out it's painfully simple— as is almost everything in the Tesla — to the point where I almost didn't trust it. All you do is walk away with the key (or your phone if you're using the Tesla app), and the car will lock and turn off automatically.I hopped out of the car and backed away slowly, waiting for the headlights to turn off or a beep to assure me the car had locked. There wasn't a beep but the lights did eventually dim and turn off.This felt weird at first, but I got used to it quickly. So much so that when I got back into my Subaru five days later, I walked out of the car while it was still running.",

    "content": "The new Tesla Model 3 is now available for test drives at several Tesla Showrooms. It was available just an hour from me, so I decided to drive up and give it a spin.\nThe first Tesla I ever drove was a Model 3 back in 2019 when I first started writing for Teslarati. Since then, I have had the chance to drive the four models in its lineup. The Cybertruck is not yet available near me, but when it is, I’ll be sure to take that for a spin, too.\nMy expectations going into the drive were pretty standard. I knew that Tesla had changed a lot about the car, and I really do love the new look of the Model 3; it’s sporty and sleek, and just a better aesthetic than what was previously offered. However, looks only go so far, and what I was really interested in was the true performance and interior changes that the new Model 3 equipped.\nIt definitely was not what I expected, and I was pleasantly surprised by some features but underwhelmed by others.\nFirst Thoughts and Initial Impressions\nWhen I arrived, I was pleasantly surprised by the look. I really do like the new front end of the car. It looks sporty and tough and clean, but also it just seems more appealing. I think the legacy Model 3 is a good design, but it was just too generic when comparing it to this option.\nThe new headlight design is sleek and slim and, from the outside, you truly do think you’re getting into something that is super luxurious. I also loved this color in particular. I usually like white cars, but this Stealth Grey was super clean.\nThe new interior is similar to the legacy Model 3 interior, but there are a few noticeable changes. I will say I don’t think I’d ever want to own a car without stalks. I totally understand the removal of things in preparation for Full Self-Driving, but we’re pretty far off from having a fully autonomous vehicle, so I think there should be an option for people to have traditional stalks.\nWithout them, and without a lot of other things, the interior of this car just feels empty. I am still a firm believer in having some more physical buttons and knobs because things are easier to adjust and are more accessible that way. In my car, I am able to change the climate, adjust which vents are active, and control other features, like my drive mode, with the touch of a button or the turn of a knob. It takes less than five seconds to do so.\nIn the Model 3, it takes a few touches on the center screen to adjust everything from the mirrors to the steering wheel. To me, it’s too much of a process to perform these simple tasks, and the lack of things to look at is something I personally do not enjoy. I do understand the appeal, though.\nTesla moved from haptics to physical buttons on this new steering wheel, which was an interesting touch. It only took me about three or four turns, or roughly ten minutes, to realize I needed to stop reaching for stalks. I feel like the buttons are super convenient, but there were times I would push the edges or corners, and the signal would not come on.\nYou have to push the center of the signal button for it to activate, and it also holds that hand captive on that portion of the wheel.\nThe high-beam button is also where things get dicey. During my drive, someone was attempting to merge over into my lane in front of me. I flashed my lights at him to get over, which he did. But it was more difficult than just flicking a stalk a couple of times.\nI totally realize that these are pretty tedious complaints, but I do believe there are some people who would see this as such an inconvenience that it would stop them from buying a car.\nA lot of things I liked, including the ventilated seats, the wireless charger, the center console, and the cup holder covers are a sleek touch. Everything felt very high-quality. There was not very much creaking or movement from these parts, which can sometimes be cheap and seem like an inferior quality. This was not the case in this car, I was really impressed with everything.\nIt is fun to drive an electric car. Every EV I have ever had the opportunity to drive has been more fun than a gas version that is similar. The Model 3 is definitely an improvement from its legacy build, and I was impressed by the suspension feel, the cabin noise reduction, and the overall ride quality in general.\nI started on a four-lane highway that featured stoplights to test how it felt in traffic. It was as you’d expect. Where I really wanted to test it was on backroads in Pennsylvania, which there are plenty of. This is where the most fun driving is done, at least in my opinion.\nI took it on some windy and tight backroads and it hugged the corners super well. The suspension kept the car feeling sporty and capable during some of the curves. I tried to push the car as much as I could responsibly, and it passed with flying colors. I will say there are only a handful of vehicles that have given be this amount of confidence when taking turns with some speed, one of them being the Ford Mustang Mach-E.\nEven the updated Model 3 outperformed the Mustang Mach-E, which was one of the most fun driving experiences I have had in recent memory.\nI had a Rear-Wheel-Drive version of this car, and it was missing that truly face-melting instant torque that I have had in other cars, especially the Long Range All-Wheel-Drive and Performance configurations that I’ve driven in the past.\nFor me, I don’t drive super fast. I was in a couple of car accidents in high school as a passenger, and they taught me to be more responsible on the road. I know when I have to drive with some aggressiveness and with some speed, and it is not often. However, this configuration was just not enough pep for me. If I were to make an order, I’d be going a step up.\nA couple of things worth mentioning are the rear legroom, the rear touchscreen, trunk and frunk space, and the road noise.\nI am 5′ 8″, and I did not move the driver’s throne when I decided to hop in the backseat to see how much room there was.\nThere wasn’t much, and I don’t know if I could see myself being strong enough or patient enough to make it more than a few hours with such little space to move.\nFor a sedan, it’s pretty understandable to have limited space. You will be stuck in this generic position for most of the ride, but the back is definitely more suitable for children.\nI think the rear touchscreen is a nice addition. A lot of cars have one now, and it is a good thing to have. It is packed with features to keep your rear occupants busy, but I feel that it is more of a novelty move than anything. It’s a decent size, can play some of the games in the Tesla Arcade, and streaming is available.\nThe frunk and power trunk are both spacious and provide room for a lot of things. I couldn’t get a good gauge on how much luggage you could fit in the trunk, but the frunk space would be nice for those daily trips to the grocery store to pick up odds and ends.\nMy biggest concern would be fitting a few golf bags in the trunk, and it seems like two or three would be the limit there.\nLast week, I had to drive to Penn State to cover a wrestling match, and I went by myself. Spending 10-12 hours in front of a computer screen daily, constantly having to listen to things, living with a dog, and barely ever having peace and quiet prompted me to turn the stereo off and take the two-hour trip in silence. It was great.\nOne thing I truly love about this new Model 3 is the cabin noise. It was so quiet in the car and so peaceful, that it was undoubtedly my favorite part of the test drive. I never turned the music on once, I just chose to drive in the quiet, and I really liked how peaceful it was inside the cabin because road noise has been a huge complaint of some drivers in the past. I didn’t have that issue at all.\nTesla did a good job of improving some of the parts of the Model 3 with this update. The sleek and sporty exterior look is great, the amount of noise in the cabin was excellent, and the suspension and ride comfort were top notch.\nWere there things I wish were different? Yes. Absolutely. I wish stalks were still a thing, I wish changing climate control settings and other things that are commonly adjusted throughout the course of a drive were more easily accessible.\nDo I think this is a mini Model S? It’s tough to say. Personally, the interior of this car makes me feel like I’m not getting much for the price. I didn’t feel blown away by the inside of the car from an aesthetic perspective. It just felt too minimalistic, and I’ve liked driving other Teslas more than this.\n“Would I trade in my current car for this one?” is the question I ask myself when I have the opportunity to drive other vehicles. I did not get that impression from the Model 3. In fact, the Model X and Model Y are the only two cars I’d even remotely consider at this point from Tesla, but there are a few reasons for that.\nI prefer an SUV or something with more interior space than I truly need,\nI drive my car on the beach every year; I wouldn’t sacrifice that privilege for a sedan that doesn’t blow me away in every aspect,\nThe minimalism truly is a major turn off for me. I liked the stalks, the display behind the steering wheel in the Model X and S, and more things to look at\nDid Tesla improve this car? Yes. Was it the best EV I’ve ever driven? No. But it’s also the entry-level Tesla, and if you want more, you have to pay more, or settle for another car. It is unrealistic to expect this vehicle to check off all the boxes at this price. Is it a good car for a first-time/young driver? Absolutely. It is something I’d consider if I drove an hour to Baltimore or 45 minutes to Harrisburg for work. As someone who works from home and spends a limited amount of time behind the wheel, it would not be my first choice. But, it’s still a great car.\nWhat did you think of my Model 3 review? Were there things I missed? Things you’d like to hear about further? Shoot me an email at joey@teslarati.com.\nI drove the new Tesla Model 3, here’s what got better",

    "content": "An icon in the shape of an angle pointing down.\nA Tesla Model 3 in Michigan (Left) and another in California (Right). Our test drive revealed regional quirks in how EV ownership differs across the country.\nNora Naughton | Alistair Barr\nCharging was where our experiences differed the most.Cold weather in Detroit had a bigger impact on range.A Tesla Model 3 isn't all that special in San Francisco.\nAccess your favorite topics in a personalized feed while you're on the go.\nElectric vehicles had a big year in 2023, hitting nearly 10% sales in the US, as more options and better deals convince new buyers to make the switch.But adoption rates vary drastically by region, driven by state incentives, regional climates, culture differences, and varying levels of political support for alternatively fueled vehicles.As plug-ins become more commonplace, I wanted to get a better idea of why these EV hotspots and deserts exist, so I asked my colleague Alistair Barr in Silicon Valley if he would do a little experiment with me: We would each drive a Tesla for a week in our respective cities and compare the experience.The San Francisco Bay Area and Detroit make for a good comparison, given a strong EV culture in Silicon Valley and California overall, versus Detroit's ingrained car culture as the home to the Big Three automakers.Both cities are car-infrastructure heavy, making our experiences comparable from a day-to-day perspective. After five days with our respective Model 3s (mine rented from Hertz, and Alistair's borrowed from friends) we sat down to compare our experiences:\nFirst impressions: The Model 3 has a cool factor and it’s fun to drive\nClose-up of a Tesla Model 3\nNora Naughton: For me, the cool factor of driving the Model 3 around town was the most fun. I was stopped by lots of people in grocery store parking lots and by friends who wanted to know if I liked the Tesla.Alistair Barr: I'm still jazzed by the speed and tight handling. The driving performance is so good for the price. A BMW or other luxury car with similar stats would be $60,000 or way more. And you can get one of these Model 3 cars for below $40,000 easily. Even after a decade of EVs, I'm still blown away by that.NN: In my experience, driving an EV, Tesla or otherwise, is always more fun. That instant torque is hard to beat. And yes, the Model 3 is the best deal out there for everything you get in return. I was renting mine from Hertz, so it was especially bare bones and still one of the coolest/most fun cars I've driven.\nBut there were some annoying quirks\nClose up of a Tesla Model 3 door handle\nAB: The freakin' door handles. Come on! Do you have to push them in every time to pop them out? Normal door handles, please. I was still irked by having to do this after several days of driving.NN: That's so funny because the door handles barely phased me. My 20-month-old loved pressing the handle to make it pop out. The fit and finish on my Model 3 were the most disappointing. I dealt with very loud wind noises, especially at higher speeds. And in Detroit almost all of the driving is highway driving.AB: The Autopilot experience was disconcerting at first. I was driving with my friend, who lent me his Model 3.He took me on Highway 280 in Silicon Valley and showed me how to turn it on. I wanted to not touch the steering wheel, but the Tesla software alerts you soon after you let go. You must have your hands on the wheel, but not control it too much otherwise the Autopilot switches off and hands control back to you. This \"in-between\" mode was strange for me at first. Resting my hands on the wheel but not trying to steer. After that first try, I didn't engage Autopilot again. I'm a car buff. I'm not interested in Autopilot. I like to drive.NN: I'm glad you got to try out Autopilot! I didn't try it with my Model 3. I don't think the Hertz models have it equipped, but even if they did I wasn't going to try it unsupervised.\nCharging was where our experiences differed the most\nMy Tesla Model 3, sufficiently dirty from winter roads in Michigan, sitting at a Supercharger\nNN: I had to charge my Model 3 four times in five days. One of those trips to the charger was a pointless 15 minutes where I just charged to what I had started when I left the house.AB: I charged once in about five days of driving. I also didn't drive as far as you. And it was warmer in Silicon Valley than Detroit. Do you think that was the big decider here? Full disclosure: I borrowed two Model 3s from two friends. (Thank you Lennie and Bruce!) I had one for three days and another for two days, so I survived by giving one car back (to Lennie) with not much juice left in it. Sorry mate. Then I charged Bruce's vehicle once at a Tesla Supercharger station.NN: I'd say the two cars probably helped you out, but overall I think I struggled more here because I drive a lot more in the Detroit area (everything in the Midwest is far apart) and we had freezing weather the whole week.\nThe cold weather hampered both of our charging experiences\nTesla Model 3 rental in my driveway\nAB: You had real challenges with the weather, right? Deal killers?NN: Definitely deal killers for me. The cold weather's effect on the battery meant I was still spending a lot of my time chasing range. I never had a moment where I couldn't find a charger when I needed one, but all of the Supercharger stations here are tucked away. What about you? How was your one charging experience? How long were you there?AB: Even in Silicon Valley, the \"cold\" (California cold to be clear) was a factor here. When I got into the Model 3 during the mornings, the battery had lost some power overnight. There was a \"cold\" icon near the battery level icon. It did make me wonder about you in Detroit in the winter.\nNeither of us had to wait to charge\nTeslas parked at Supercharger stations in San Francisco\nAB: This might be one part of American society where the roles have flipped. Californians are pretty sunny friendly people, compared to gruff New Yorkers. But at Supercharger stations, it's down to business.My Tesla Supercharger trip involved no nice interactions with other humans. They were all sitting in their cars staring at their phones.There were about 9 cars getting charged and about 6 or 7 spots open when I got there, so I did not have to wait. A couple of the charging stations had big crosses on them, which I assume meant that they were not working.I was at about 55 miles left, and after about 10 minutes I was up to 115 miles charge. The session cost about $7.50 which was charged automatically to my friend's account at Tesla (I repaid him).NN: I've heard those California stations can get busy so I'm glad you didn't have to wait. The Supercharger I went to in Detroit was the busiest, and I nabbed the last spot at 10:30 pm, but it's rare to ever see any EVs lined up at chargers here. I also didn't have to pay for charging. It was free with my Tesla rental, which saved me money given how much I had to charge!\nWe had different experiences with range anxiety\nClose-up of Tesla Model 3 charging at a Tesla Supercharger\nAB: I think you had range on the brain more than me? Why?NN: Some of it might be my previous EV experiences. When I had a Chevy Bolt for 2 weeks in 2019, I had a few moments on a road trip where I really was almost stranded without power. That past range anxiety loomed large, and I was constantly trying to avoid a repeat. I also just watched my battery drain every day due to the cold, and that was really disheartening.(Programming note: Tesla just lowered the estimated ranges for most of its vehicles recently.)AB: I noticed the lower battery charge on those cold mornings. I think that would have weighed more on my mind had I been commuting regularly and absolutely had to be somewhere else far away.NN: I work from home, but I have a lot of extracurricular activities (I'm downtown at least two nights a week) and I pick up my kid from daycare every day, which is a 7-mile round trip. I was constantly doing mileage math.\nOur access to Superchargers was about the same\nOne of my many stops at Tesla Superchargers during my five-day rental\nAB: The bar is gas stations, right? I have two or three gas stations within about a five-minute drive from my home. Always open, always takes five minutes to fill up. Compared with that, finding an EV charging station is still a relative pain in the butt — even in Silicon Valley, which is supposed to be ahead.NN: Yeah if we're using gas stations as the bar, I live close to a big highway exit with four or five big gas stations. I can throw a stone and hit a pump from my driveway. Conversely, the only Supercharger in (reasonable) driving distance from my house was a town over, about a 15 minute drive. Interesting that you had basically the same experience with your closest Supercharger station.\nThe Model 3 turned more heads in Detroit\nTesla Model 3 Hertz rental\nAB: I didn't get anyone stopping to ask me about the Model 3s I drove. In Silicon Valley, the EV driving experience felt oddly unspecial. In a 15-minute drive back from Bruce's house to mine, I passed more than 20, most of which were Teslas.On one street in my town, which was two blocks long, I drove by nine EVs parked in driveways — three of those homes had solar panels on the roof. It did not feel special or ground-breaking to be driving an EV around.NN: Even though Teslas have definitely become more commonplace here in the last few years, I still got stopped plenty of times by strangers who wanted to know what a Tesla was like. It was a big conversation piece among friends, too, most of whom have never been in an electric car, let alone driven one.AB: I have to ask this, given Elon Musk's behavior. Was anyone not into Teslas specifically due to Musk's rep?NN: Yes, Musk definitely came up as a reason to dislike Tesla, and some of the people who would stop me actually would ask what I thought of Elon Musk rather than what I thought of the car. I always tell them he's an interesting character to follow!\nIt's still a tricky equation when deciding if we could own one full-time\nTesla Model 3 outside a house in San Francisco\nAB: I have a $100 deposit on a Cybertruck. I'm thinking about getting that, but I'm low on the list so I have along time to think about it. With my solar panels and the way I live and work – from home a lot – it would make financial sense to have one of our family cars be an EV. I am wasting the opportunity to save money with my solar panels right now.NN: In general I would love to have an EV if I could justify one. They're fun to drive, cheaper to maintain, and let's face it, a status symbol. Consider as well the environmental benefits and it all adds up for me – until I look at the miles I drive a week and the temps I deal with from November to April.AB: Yeah, that's a huge obstacle. So, I have my Subaru back now, and I have to fill up with gas again. That's a more expensive proposition in California compared to Detroit. According to AAA, the average price of regular gas in California was $4.63 in early December during my test drives. The average in Michigan was $2.99 at that time. With an 18.5 gallon gas tank on my Outback, that's $87 to fill up. The same fillup in Michigan would cost $55.NN: I have to admit when I pulled my Subaru Crosstrek back on the road for the first time, I relished that smoother ride after five days of one-pedal driving.AB: That's funny because I felt differently getting back into my Subaru. (We're both huge Subaru fans. I love my Outback so much.) But I was struck by the noise after getting back in the car. In comparison, the Model 3 is a lot smoother and quieter. After a week of driving this EV, I feel like this is now the way cars should be.NN: That's such an interesting takeaway. I think the wind noise in my Model 3 prevented me from having that experience. My Crosstrek was decidedly quieter since there wasn't wind flapping in my ear at all moments. But I did miss that lurch forward on the highway on-ramp. Ah, instant torque.",

    "content": "I've been a passenger in plenty of Teslas over the years, and I have friends who own one — but I'd never been behind the wheel to really get a feel of what it's like to drive one.I figured there was only one way to resolve this problem: Rent a Tesla. As I picked a holiday weekend in the UK last month to do so, none seemed available from rental firms, so I found a shiny gray 2022 Model 3 on Turo (despite a frankly outrageous \"service\" fee).\nI rented this Model 3 on Turo.\nGaining access to the Tesla was a clever procedure. I downloaded the Tesla app on my iPhone and the owner added me to his account, meaning no physical key was needed. This was just as well, as the owner was away at the time. (I'm not quite sure what would've happened if I'd lost my phone during the rental, though. And the tech has not been faultless either.)So on this sunny Saturday my friend, who was visiting from Atlanta, and I set off from East London for Oxford — a journey of about 80 miles, which nevertheless took well over two hours because British roads are not quite as wide as those in America.\nThe Radcliffe Camera is one of the best-known buildings in Oxford, England.\nConnecting my iPhone to the audio system was simple, and there are convenient twin cordless charging pads built into the central console. The soundtrack for our trip included Dua Lipa's \"Radical Optimism\" and the latest Pet Shop Boys album, \"Nonetheless.\" Both sounded great through the car's array of speakers.\nWhat I found incongruous, though, was the fake-looking wood paneling on the dashboard. It feels out of place, and I have no idea why it's there. (Tesla wisely got rid of it in the recent Model 3 refresh.)\nThe interior of the Telsa Model 3.\nThe Tesla's interior is dominated by an enormous touchscreen that controls every function of the car. It serves up a cavalcade of information, and I often found it difficult to hit the right bit of the screen without taking my eyes off the road, though I admit it makes navigation easier.\nThe Model 3's touchscreen is big. Really big.\nThe lane-assist and hazard-warning technology can often be too clever for its own good, getting overexcited about supposed dangers that are nothing of the sort.The trunk is cavernous and could easily accommodate the luggage of four or even five people.\nThe trunk of the Tesla Model 3 could fit quite a lot of luggage.\nThe Model 3 is a very quiet drive, as you might expect of any contemporary EV. It handles well and does pretty much everything you might expect such a car to do, but I just couldn't shake off the feeling that something was missing. If I had to sum it up in a sentence, it'd be this: The Tesla was just a bit boring.Maybe it's comparable to a movie or TV show with a three-star review — I want it to be either really great, or really bad. Being somewhere in the middle is just \"meh.\" And I suspect this is going to be one of Tesla's biggest problems in the coming years.Back in the day, if you wanted to show you cared to some degree about the environment (and had fairly deep pockets), driving a Tesla was a no-brainer — as long as you had a garage with a Powerwall and didn't make lots of long trips, that is. (I opted to return my Model 3 without recharging it, so I can't comment on the difficulty of finding somewhere to plug in the car — but I'm glad I didn't have to.)Tesla now has plenty of competition from legacy automakers, its vehicles are still reasonably expensive, and some of the people who bought them in the past may not be repeat customers for a variety of reasons.Then there's the realization by some drivers and manufacturers, too, that hybrids might be a better bridge to a greener motoring world than pure electric.Nevertheless, it's worth noting that Tesla increased its share of the US car market in the first quarter to 51.3%, with Ford a distant second at 7.4%.I'm grateful I got to take the Model 3 for a spin so I could make up my own mind, but sorry Elon — I'm still no Tesla fanboy.What do you think about Teslas or EVs? Get in touch: cjohnston@businessinsider.com June 19, 2024, 8:40 a.m. ET: This story was updated to clarify that the interior paneling in the Model 3 that the author drove looked like fake wood to the author, who did not confirm the type of material used. An earlier version of this story also included editing notes that were not meant for publication; they have been removed.\nI was surprised by how small the space under the hood was.",

    "content": "Tesla has cut its prices again in a number of major markets - including the US, China and Germany - as the electric car giant run by multi-billionaire Elon Musk faces falling sales.The move comes after it reported a sharp fall in its global vehicle deliveries in the first three months of this year.A price war has been intensifying between electric vehicle (EV) makers, with particularly fierce competition coming from Chinese firms.Tesla is due to report financial results for the first quarter of 2024 after the US market close on Tuesday.In a post on social media platform X, formerly Twitter, Mr Musk said: \"Tesla prices must change frequently in order to match production with demand.\"In China, the firm cut the starting price of the revamped Model 3 in China by 14,000 yuan (£1,562) to 231,900 yuan.Prices of the Model Y, Model X and Model S vehicles in the US were reduced by $2,000 (£1,616) on Friday.There were also price cuts in many other countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, according Reuters, the news agency.BBC News has contacted Tesla for comment.The company triggered an EV price war over a year ago when it aggressively cut prices at the expense of profit margins.The firm has been slow to refresh its ageing models while rivals in China, such as BYD and Nio, have been rolling out cheaper models. Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi also launched its first EV last month.Last week, Tesla announced plans to lay off more than 10% of its global workforce.Over the weekend, Mr Musk said he would postpone a planned trip to India, where he was due to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi, due to \"very heavy Tesla obligations\".On Friday, the firm recalled thousands of its new Cybertrucks over safety concerns.It is because their accelerator pedals currently risk getting trapped by the interior trim, increasing the possibility of crashes.Tesla's shares have fallen by more than 40% since the start of this year.",

    "content": "For years, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been promising an affordable electric vehicle, likely priced at $25,000, as a way to broaden the appeal of plug-in vehicles. He first mentioned it in a 2018 interview with YouTuber Marques Brownlee, saying “a $25,000 car, that’s something we can do.” Then in 2020, at the company’s first Battery Day event, he speculated that Tesla could eventually produce upward of 20 million of these vehicles in a year — or roughly twice the current production of Toyota, GM, or Volkswagen. Things started to accelerate last year at Tesla’s shareholder event, where the company’s executives spoke about a specialized manufacturing technique that they called the “Unboxed Process.” This breakthrough would allow Tesla to dramatically reduce the cost of manufacturing, enabling it to sell a vehicle at the $25,000 price point. The next-gen vehicle will likely be a crossover or hatchback and could feature design elements lifted from the Tesla Cybertruck. But moreover, it would be the fulfillment of a promise made years ago to make EVs more affordable to the masses. Elon Musk makes a lot of promises, some of which he can’t keep. Let’s hope this isn’t one of them. A cheaper Tesla is back on the menuThe Model 3 might get an affordable younger sibling in 2025. Image: TeslaTesla says it will build more affordable electric vehicles — perhaps as soon as 2025 — refuting recent reports that Tesla CEO Elon Musk had canceled plans for a cheaper “Model 2” vehicle in favor of getting a robotaxi out the door. But Musk didn’t clarify whether the lower-cost EV would be a brand new model for Tesla or simplified versions of its current vehicles.“In terms of a new product roadmap, there’s been a lot of talk,” Musk said during the company’s first quarter earnings call, addressing the concerns investors have expressed over the past month about the delayed plans for a low-cost EV. “We’ve updated our future vehicle lineup to accelerate the launch of new models.” Musk said we might see the vehicles in early 2025, if not later this year.Read Article >Tesla warns of sales growth slowdown as it prepares for next-gen launch in late 2025Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The VergeTesla reported earnings of $7.9 billion in net income on $25.2 billion in revenue during the fourth quarter of 2023. The figures represent an increase in revenue, up from $24.3 billion the same time last year. The company added that its vehicle volume growth rate in 2024 “may be notably lower” than it was in 2023 as it works to launch Tesla’s next-gen vehicle.Responding to a question about its next-gen vehicles during the earnings call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company is targeting production “towards the end of 2025” but warned of delays due to the complexities of the manufacturing process. “We are focused on bringing the next generation platform to market as quickly as we can, with the plan to start production at Gigafactory Texas,” Tesla said in a note to shareholders. “This platform will revolutionize how vehicles are manufactured.” Read Article >Tesla’s new compact crossover is reportedly coming in 2025, but will it cost $25,000?Concept Tesla design images shown off in a recent corporate video. Image: TeslaTesla is eying a June 2025 kickoff for production of a new mass-market compact crossover, Reuters reports. The company has apparently invited suppliers to bid to work on the car, and is forecasting producing 10,000 vehicles weekly. Following publication of this story, Tesla CEO Elon Musk responded to a question about “next-generation platform vehicles” during an earnings call by saying production would start “towards the end of 2025.” He also said the first manufacturing location for the company’s next-gen vehicle would be in Austin, Texas. No specifics on the features or pricing of the vehicles were offered, and Musk warned that his timeline “should be taken with a grain of salt” due to the complexities of developing new manufacturing technologies. “You have to design a machine that has never existed to build a car in a way that has never existed,” added Musk.Read Article >Tesla’s new car-building process could be a huge industrial breakthroughPhoto by Loren Grush / The VergeTesla is closing in on a new manufacturing process that could significantly reduce costs and increase production of its electric vehicles. According to sources who spoke to Reuters, the new process will enable the automaker to die-cast almost the entire vehicle underbody as a single piece instead of building out about 400 parts using conventional car-building techniques.Tesla’s current process to build its popular Model Y SUV already involves a unique use of massive, ultra-high pressure presses that can mold both the front and rear parts of the vehicle. Tesla calls this process “gigacasting,” which some experts say is already highly efficient and cost-effective compared to other automakers’ factories. But now Tesla is looking to up the ante.Read Article >Tesla’s $25,000 ‘next-generation car’ will have a Cybertruck designIllustration by Alex Castro / The VergeTesla is reportedly preparing to build a $25,000 electric car built on the company’s next-generation engineering platform. Axios reports that Elon Musk biographer Walter Isaacson has detailed the plan to build a $25,000 electric car alongside an autonomous robotaxi that could ferry passengers around.The $25,000 car reportedly has a futuristic design like the long-delayed Cybertruck — the angular pickup truck that Tesla first revealed in 2019. The Cybertruck will supposedly begin production this year, with production-at-scale beginning in 2024.Read Article >Elon Musk unveils a new Master Plan, a path to sustainable energy future, but no new carsElon Musk revealed the third part of Tesla’s “Master Plan,” in which the company will lead the global effort to eliminate fossil fuels and convert the world to sustainable energy. The plan was outlined during an investor event Wednesday held at the company’s Gigafactory in Austin, Texas.Master Plan 3 includes adding renewable power to the existing grid, producing more electric vehicles, installing heat pumps in homes and buildings, using high-temperature heat delivery and hydrogen for industrial applications, and building sustainably fueled planes and boats. Musk’s plan is to create “a sustainable energy civilization.”Read Article >Tesla’s Elon Musk said a $25,000 electric car with next-gen battery in the worksTesla announced that it will dramatically reduce the cost of its battery cells and packs — which means the company’s new goal is a $25,000 electric car. The company’s CEO Elon Musk said its new “tabless” battery cells, as well as by changing the materials inside the cell, will allow Tesla to “halve” the price per kilowatt-hour, which will make electric cars roughly the same price as combustion engine ones. The price per kilowatt-hour (kWh) is the unit of energy most commonly used to measure the capacity of the battery packs in modern electric vehicles. Those prices have been falling dramatically over the last decade, from $1,100/kWh in 2010 to $156/kWh in 2019, a drop of 87 percent. Read Article >",

    "content": "When Tesla first hit the mass-market scene with the Model S, it rightfully shocked the world. There was nothing else like it. At the time, no other electric car on the planet was as good, none had even half the range it had, and no one could keep up. It took more than a decade for mainstream brands to get anywhere near the Model S in terms of range, performance, and technology. However, competitors have finally caught up and even Tesla’s more affordable, entry-level car—the refreshed 2024 Tesla Model 3 Highland—has lost its luster.\nThe Model 3 I drove was a dual-motor car with the Autopilot “Full Self-Driving” system equipped and subscribed to. I only had a couple of days with it, so I couldn’t test it as thoroughly as I normally would. However, I don’t think I needed to. I got the gist of it in the short time I had and my consensus is this: buy a Hyundai Ioniq 6 instead.\nWhether it’s because Elon is afraid of criticism, can’t afford a press fleet, or simply does not care, Tesla doesn’t do press cars. Special thanks to the fine folks at Turo, though, who comped us a three-day rental. If you want to check out this Model 3 in New York, you can find it here.\nI can still remember staying up until 2 a.m. on the East Coast to cover the initial launch event for the Tesla Model 3 in 2017. Back then, it was a big deal. Perhaps not as big of a deal as the Model S was originally, but the Model 3 still changed the game. Finally, a semi-affordable electric sedan from Tesla that not only had more range than its competition but cost less. However, it took six years for Tesla to give it any significant updates. BMW, Mercedes, and Audi—its primary internal combustion competitors—would have entirely new models out by then. Now, though, it’s finally been updated and the refreshed Model 3 is better in many ways than its predecessor. But it’s also worse in others.\nFrom the outside, there’s no question that the Model 3 Highland is prettier than the original. Its headlights are slim and sharp, its front end is pointier, and its taillight design is much more upscale. Granted, it still looks like a jelly bean and is incredibly boring to look at in grayscale colors but it’s an improvement over the aging 2017 car.\nInside, it’s mostly the same, though. Which is to say, it’s shit. I really try not to criticize interior ergonomics or design too hard unless it significantly hinders the driving experience. Even odd interiors will be learned by their customers. However, the Model 3 is almost dangerously bad inside. The seats are miserable (although I hear the new Model 3 Performance seats are excellent), every surface and material feels econobox-cheap, and the ergonomics can genuinely cause crashes.\nLike with all Teslas nowadays, there’s no wiper stalk. Or side mirror controls. Or even steering wheel adjustments on the column itself. Everything, and I mean literally everything, needs to be controlled via the massive tablet-style touchscreen, with its dizzying amount of menus and tiny smartphone-sized icons. Not only do you have to take your eyes off the road to use it, but you also have to focus on touching the right icons because they’re small and all very similar looking. The menus have a very similar UI design, color scheme, and font to an iPad, which is great when the car is stationary but maddening while moving.\nIt’s infuriating and easily the dumbest user interface I’ve ever encountered, on any device, in my entire life. However, the newest dumb thing Tesla did with the Model 3 was move the gear select controls to the touchscreen. To put the car into drive, you need to step on the brake like normal but then slide a skinny bar upward on the left part of the touchscreen. To reverse, you slide it down. It works OK, but several times in less than two days, it failed to register my swipe.\nThere are redundant drive select buttons, though. But do you know where they are? Built into the interior lighting panel on the headliner, between the sun visors. Since Tesla wants the touch slider to be the primary control, the redundant buttons only illuminate when you use them. So if you want to turn on a dome light while driving, you can easily accidentally press a drive button and get a frighteningly loud beep beep as the car warns you that it can’t go into reverse while moving forward. It’s almost like whoever designed the cabin never drove a car before.\nDriving the Tesla Model 3\nThankfully, the Model 3 is still as quick as ever, so you can enjoy a little speed to make yourself forget about the frustrating controls. Two electric motors make 394 horsepower and 377 lb-ft of torque and launch the little Model 3 forward hard enough to make you forget about the Performance model. 60 mph arrives in 4.2 seconds, just 0.5 seconds slower than the BMW i4 M50. Buyers certainly don’t need anything quicker and, by the seat of the pants, the dual-motor Model 3 feels practically just as quick as that BMW.\nWhen the Model 3 originally came out, I remember hearing that its driving dynamics were genuinely close to cars like the BMW 3 Series. I was told that it was among the best sports sedans in the world. Now that I’ve driven one, I can finally, honestly say… bullshit. It’s good, don’t get me wrong. But it’s far from great. Its steering is hyperactive to the point of feeling incredibly fake and it self-centers with such an artificial rubber-banding that it actually becomes annoying. It’s accurate but there’s zero feel and the ratio is so quick that it feels overly twitchy at speed.\nThen there’s the ride, which is brittle. On smooth surfaces, it feels planted and solid. However, sharper bumps can upset that planted feeling. It isn’t horrible, but it’s certainly not as composed or as comfortable as something like the BMW i4 or Polestar 2. It’s more on par with the Ioniq 6. While it can be fun through twisty corners, it feels too rubbery and artificial to be genuinely engaging. So, it’s an OK sport sedan but far from a great one.\nNow, here’s the part where I get to talk about Elon Musk’s infamous “Autopilot with Full Self-Driving.” With the system set to its most comprehensive setting, allowing it to “drive itself” to the fullest of its abilities, I tested it on both normal and stop-and-go roads and highways. For the most part, it works well. It keeps itself in a lane perfectly, it shows you exactly what it sees and what it’s doing, it can stop at red lights, and it can follow traffic just fine. I also like that it tells you why it’s doing certain things, like, for example, changing into a faster lane to better match your desired speed, which I appreciate.\nIt ain’t perfect, though. Twice, it failed to recognize a lane split, choosing to take a highway exit instead of staying straight. And when you need to correct it, the steering wheel aggressively tries to stay its course. Then, when you finally do correct it, Autopilot disengages, requiring you to start it again. Tesla needs to tone its aggressive throttle down, too. Even in its “Chill” setting, it accelerates too quickly from a stop and I had to quickly act to disengage it when it tried to quickly move around a cop car that had pulled another driver over. It’s impressive, there’s no doubt, and among the best on the market, but GM’s Super Cruise is still the superior, more nuanced system.\nWithout a doubt, the best part of the Model 3 is Tesla’s charging experience. Using a Tesla Supercharger is, by far, the easiest public EV charging experience out there. Simply drive up to a station, plug in, and walk away. There’s no fussing with accounts, credit cards, payments, screens, mobile apps, or anything else. You just plug in. That’s it. You can see why other brands like Ford and Rivian are going to start using them. But the Model 3 is also a quick little car that makes easy work of slicing through traffic and merging onto highways. Forward visibility is impressive. The dual wireless phone charging tray is pretty great and the rear touchscreen will make kids in the back seat go “Ohhhhh” and “Ahhhhh.”\nUnfortunately, there are a lot of low points. The interior just feels cheap and underequipped, especially for the price. The $28K-to-start Hyundai Kona is nicer inside, and its ergonomics would infuriate me every time I drove it. There was a sharp edge on the rear passenger door, so I cut myself when opening it once—an Easter egg tipping its cap to the Cybertruck, perhaps. It’s also noisy inside, with tons of wind and tire noise at high speed, even with double-pane windows. And the car seat LATCH points in the rear are difficult to hook onto.\nTesla Model 3 Features, Options, and Competition\nThe Tesla Model 3 is one of the more affordable EVs in its class, with a starting price of $40,380 before federal and state tax incentives. The long-range AWD model I tested starts at $48,880 before it all. However, it comes relatively well-equipped with heated seats, the massive touchscreen that controls damn near everything, a rear seat screen, and all of its other snazzy gizmos as standard. As of this writing, the Model 3 is also eligible for the full $7,500 federal tax incentive under the Inflation Reduction Act.\nThere actually isn’t much of an options list to speak of for the Model 3. You choose your powertrain, color, wheels, and whether you want “Full Self-Driving Capability.” The latter of which—despite it being a misnomer at best, bald-faced lie at worst—costs $8,000. Every color except for Space Gray is an optional extra, with prices ranging from $1,000 to $2,000. Since my test car was Space Gray with the basic wheels (the only other wheel option costs $1,000) and FSD, its as-tested price was $57,130.\nThe Model 3’s closest competitor, in terms of price, performance, and quality, is probably the aforementioned Hyundai Ioniq 6. The BMW i4 is much nicer inside and the better sports sedan but it’s significantly more expensive, with a starting price north of $60,000 for a dual-motor car. The Polestar 2 is pushing 60 grand if you’d like the AWD version. Meanwhile, Hyundai will sell you a fully loaded Ioniq 6 Limited with a dual-motor powertrain for under $55,000 before incentives. Its only downside is being low on range compared to the Model 3, with just 270 miles compared to the Tesla’s 341. However, Hyundais will be able to use Tesla’s Supercharger network starting in Q4 of this year.\nWith 341 miles of range, the Model 3 bests every one of its competitors. The only EVs on the market with a higher range cost significantly more, such as the Lucid Air and Mercedes EQS. During my time with it, however, I averaged over 3 miles per kWh, which is pretty dang good.\nMore important than range, though, is charge speed. If you can charge up quickly and conveniently, outright, full-charge range becomes less of a concern. And there’s no easier charging solution than Tesla’s Superchargers. They just work brilliantly. If you’ve ever fussed with an Electrify America station, you know that charging any other electric car can be maddening. You plug the car in, wait for the station to connect, either link your account or pay with a card, wait again for it all to initialize, then it starts charging. It is routinely a multi-minute process before electrons even begin flowing. And that’s if it actually works properly, which is far from a guarantee. However, there’s no fuss with a Supercharger. You simply plug in and walk away. When you’re done, you press the button on the charging handle or a button on the interior screen, charging stops, and you unplug and drive away.\nThe 2024 Tesla Model 3 is fundamentally a good car. It’s quick, handles well enough, and has great range. However, it also comes with a lot of aggravating baggage. Just unlocking the car is annoying, having to either trust the mobile app to work properly or use the little keycard (which does not act like a keyless entry fob, you have to tap it against the B-pillar). It also feels as cheap as a ‘90s Corolla inside. Now that mainstream automakers have electric sports sedans, the only advantages the Model 3 has are range and charging—which, admittedly, are a couple of big, big advantages. But as more and more automakers switch over to the NACS port and gain Supercharger access, the latter advantage is about to become moot.\nEverything great about the Model 3 inherently—its smooth electric power, decent handling, and gas-free driving—can also be said about the Hyundai Ioniq 6. And while the Hyundai lacks the Tesla’s outright range, it’s more affordable, has a much nicer interior, comes with a far better warranty, and has a much wider dealer network (a quick search shows 820 Hyundai dealers in the U.S. versus 240 Tesla stores). Subjectively, I also think it looks far more interesting.\nThe Model 3’s importance to the market can’t be overstated, as it was a game-changer when it first came out in 2017. But since then, the competition has caught up and its luster is lost. Unless you simply must have the electric compact sedan with the most range, it’s hard to see why anyone would buy one over the current, and future, competition.\n2024 Tesla Model 3 SpecsRWDLong Range AWDBase Price (as tested)$40,630$48,880 ($57,130)Powertrainsingle-motor rear-wheel drive | 57.5-kWh batterydual-motor all-wheel drive | 82-kWh batteryHorsepower271394Torque310 lb-ft377 lb-ftSeating Capacity5<<Curb Weight3,891 pounds4,030 poundsCargo Volume21.0 cubic feet | 3.1 cubic feet (frunk)<<0-60 mph5.8 seconds4.2 secondsTop Speed125 mph<<Max Charging Speed170 kW250 kWEPA Range272 miles341 milesQuick TakeThe Model 3 is still a good car but, now that its competition has caught up, it isn’t as special as it used to be.Score7/10\nGot tips?

    "content": "I have something to confess. I have never driven or even been a passenger inside a Tesla vehicle, and I've never been a fan of the brand. But I'll test drive my first one soon, maybe next month.\nEven so, you'd be foolish to disregard how far the EV manufacturer has gone since its early Roadster days. These cars may not be as luxurious as the European-built BMWs or Mercedes-Benz cars. And it's not as sporty as Toyota's GR machine or Nissan's GT-R. But we all know Teslas aren't slow. Love it or hate it, EVs have a lot of potential. But they also have to deal with weight problems, battery issues, etc. A Tesla Model 3 can weigh as much as 4,000 lbs (1,836 kg), but the latest 2024 Performance Model will pack a strong punch at over 500 horsepower and plenty of torque.\nYou will see plenty of drag racing action on YouTube featuring these cars. And some people have even resorted to racing them around various race tracks. I spotted one such example on a special Facebook group called Apex Automotor, the gathering that brings together industry engineers, race drivers, and even top management from certain manufacturers.\nSteven took his 2024 Model 3 Performance to Laguna Seca for a test, and the car proved quite capable. He mentioned that the tires were the limiting factor throughout the run but that he also had to deal with the battery heating up. \"The new active damper works very well, at least on stock tires. I always felt like I had complete control of the car, but the same could not be said of the previous generation's car.\"\n\"I believe the new aero package also has something to do with this, especially coming over turn 1 at 120 mph (193 kph).\" He went through the 2.238 miles (3.602 km) long layout in under 100 seconds at 1:39.8. Some of you may remember that the Porsche Taycan Turbo GT set a fast lap of 1:27.87, but we're talking about a whole different price range and a professional race driver in the mix.\nI was curious to have a go myself, so I quickly powered up Gran Turismo 7 for a \"benchmark\" test. I bought the 2023 Model 3 Performance for 55,000 credits and took it for a spin. It's fast in a straight line, but I didn't enjoy breaking or turning. On my first lap, I stopped the clock at 1:41.309.\nI underestimated it, thinking either the Renault Megane RS or Mazda RX-7 would be faster. They weren't. I thought to myself, ok, the Corvette C8 should do the trick. It took me two laps on the controller to get a 1:39.805 lap. It was way more exciting than the Tesla, but the conclusion is that the Model 3 Performance is not to be taken lightly. Now, I want to drive one more than ever before.",

    "content": "Tom Gerken & Chris VallanceTechnology reportersAlamyTesla is recalling more than two million cars after the US regulator found its driver assistance system, Autopilot, was partly defective.The recall applies to almost every Tesla sold in the US since the Autopilot feature was launched in 2015.Tesla, run by billionaire Elon Musk, said it would send a software update \"over the air\" to fix the issue.The update happens automatically and does not require a visit to a dealership or garage, but is still referred to by the US regulator as a recall.The UK Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency said it was not aware of any safety issues involving Teslas in the UK, noting that cars sold in the UK are not equipped with all of the same features as cars in the US. \"Teslas sold in the UK market are not self-driving and are not approved to do so,\" a spokesperson said, adding that the agency would continue to monitor the situation.Autopilot is meant to help with steering, acceleration and braking - but, despite the name, the car still requires driver input. Tesla's software is supposed to make sure that drivers are paying attention and that the feature is only in use in appropriate conditions, such as driving on highways. But the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said a two-year investigation of 956 Tesla crashes found that \"the prominence and scope of the feature's controls may not be sufficient to prevent driver misuse\".\"Automated technology holds great promise for improving safety but only when it is deployed responsibly\", the NHTSA wrote, adding it would continue to monitor the software once it was updated.Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. According to the recall notice, the company did not concur with the agency's analysis but agreed to add new features to resolve the concerns, including additional checks on turning on the self-driving features.Lukasz Krupski, speaking after winning the Blueprint Prize which recognises whistleblowers, told the BBC: \"I don't think the hardware is ready and the software is ready\".\"It affects all of us because we are essentially experiments in public roads\", he claimed.Reacting to the news of the recall Mr Krupski told the BBC it was \"a step in the right direction\" but pointed out it was not just a problem in the US. \"The hardware is the same in all the Teslas in the US, China etc.\", he said Safety metricsOn Tuesday, Tesla defended the safety of Autopilot in a post on X (formerly Twitter) in response to a Washington Post article.\"Safety metrics are emphatically stronger when Autopilot is engaged than when not engaged\" it wrote, pointing to statistics that suggested there were fewer crashes when the system was used.Jack Stilgoe, associate professor at University College London, who researches autonomous vehicles, said Tesla should have spent more time developing the system in the first place.\"The conventional way of ensuring safety is to check that a car is safe when it leaves the factory\", he told the BBC.But despite this being the second recall this year affecting Tesla vehicles, Susannah Streeter of investment company Hargreaves Lansdown, said her assessment was that it should not check the carmaker's momentum too greatly:\"This recall of 2 million cars on its own is not likely to seriously quash enthusiasm. The share price has dropped back slightly, but it doesn't look like it'll be hit by a bad bout of skidding.\"After all, recalls in the car industry are far from unusual and the group also has the financial ability to invest in fixes\", she added.Tesla has heavily promoted the technology in its cars and says remaining at the cutting edge of self-driving is key to its future growth. Goldman Sachs analysts estimated this month that Tesla's most advanced Autopilot offering, full self driving, could end up generating more than $50bn a year in revenue by 2030, up from $1bn-$3bn presently.In the US, the full-self driving package costs $12,000, or a $199 monthly subscription fee. \"Autonomy is really where it's at,\" Mr Musk told investors this summer. Additional alertsCritics have said Tesla has misled customers about its software's capabilities, contributing to risks. The carmaker is facing other government investigations, as well as a number of lawsuits in the US in relation to crashes involving the software. But a jury in one of the first cases to go to trial found that Tesla's autopilot technology was not to blame. The new controls that Tesla has agreed to do should help limit drivers from using Autopilot unsafely, said Professor Missy Cummings, director of the Autonomy and Robotics Center at George Mason University.But she added that there was \"an opportunity missed\" for regulators to require Tesla to make Autopilot features unavailable in places where it is not supposed to be used. The recall centres on a part of Autopilot called Autosteer. Autosteer helps keep a car in the correct lane in conjunction with \"traffic-aware cruise control\" which matches the speed of the car to that of the surrounding traffic. The driver is expected to have their hands on wheel and be ready to take over from the assistive system when required.When Autosteer is on, systems in the car monitor that the driver is paying attention. If it detects the driver isn't there are warning alerts. There are also alerts if the driver tries to use Autosteer in inappropriate circumstances.According to the NHTSA recall report, the \"over the air update\" will include additional alerts and monitoring \"to encourage the driver to adhere to their continuous driving responsibility whenever Autosteer is engaged.\"",
