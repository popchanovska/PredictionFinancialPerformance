    "content": "Update on December 4, 2023 at 2:00 AM PT:\nWe are committed to an ads-supported digital business model, because it is the cornerstone of an inclusive internet where everyone can access online services and content for free. It allows people to use services like Facebook and Instagram for free while benefiting from seeing personalised advertising, helping them discover new products and brands that are most relevant to them.\nPersonalised advertising also enables businesses of all sizes – particularly small and medium-sized businesses – to find customers most likely to be interested in what they offer. This creates considerable value for businesses: in Europe, every Euro spent on our ads drives on average 3.37 Euros in revenues for advertisers, supporting over €84 billion in business revenues every year.¹\nHowever, Europe’s regulatory landscape is evolving. And with new regulatory interpretations of permitted legal bases for personalised advertising under the GDPR, as well as the coming into force of the Digital Markets Act, we are now required to offer people in the EU, EEA and Switzerland an alternative way of using Facebook and Instagram.\nThat’s why, in October, we announced that people in the EU could choose to continue to use Facebook and Instagram with ads, or they could choose to pay a monthly fee for a subscription service with no ads on Facebook and Instagram.² If a person chooses to subscribe, they won’t see ads and we will not process their information for personalised advertising.\nWe introduced this choice, called ‘Subscription for no ads’, as our consent solution to comply with a unique combination of connected and sometimes overlapping EU regulatory obligations with differing compliance deadlines.\nSubscriptions as an alternative to seeing advertising are a well-established and economically viable business model spanning many industries, from news publishing and gaming to music and entertainment. That’s why we believe it is the best compliance solution. Like countless other businesses, we believe it allows us to meet changing regulatory obligations while offering users a clear choice.\n‘Subscription for no ads’ addresses the latest regulatory developments, guidance and judgments shared by leading European regulators and the courts over recent years. Specifically, it conforms to direction given by the highest court in Europe: in July, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) endorsed the subscriptions model as a way for people to consent to data processing for personalised advertising. And even before that decision, the validity of a subscription service as part of a model to obtain valid consent had been acknowledged by numerous European data protection authorities, including in France, Denmark and Germany.\nRegardless of whether a person chooses to subscribe or not, everyone who uses Facebook and Instagram can continue to use our Privacy Centre to access the extensive range of tools that we have built to give people choice over the information they share and how we process their data. Those who choose to continue to see personalised ads will also continue to have full control over whether or not we use information from third party websites and apps to personalise the ads we show them. And as has been the case for people in the EU, EEA and Switzerland since 2018, unless a person actively opts in to see ads based on information from third parties, it won’t happen.\nAdditionally, those who choose to continue to see personalised ads can also access features to further manage how their data is used to inform their ads, including Why am I seeing this ad? and our long-standing ad preferences tools. We remain committed to ensuring that people who choose to use our services for free continue to have a positive ad experience.\nAt Meta, we believe that technology is about giving everyone a voice, and that the best way to do that is to offer services for free – and that’s why we will always advocate for an internet funded by ads.\n1. Europe’s calculations are based on methods published with the National Bureau of Economic Research. ‘Learning, Sophistication, and the Returns to Advertising: Implications for Differences in Firm Performance’ 2023. Calculations using 2022 Data.\n2. EU, EEA and Switzerland.\nOriginally published on October 30, 2023 at 5:00 AM PT:\nTo comply with evolving European regulations, we are introducing a new subscription option in the EU, EEA and Switzerland. In November, we will be offering people who use Facebook or Instagram and reside in these regions the choice to continue using these personalised services for free with ads, or subscribe to stop seeing ads. While people are subscribed, their information will not be used for ads.\nPeople in these countries will be able to subscribe for a fee to use our products without ads. Depending on where you purchase it will cost €9.99/month on the web or €12.99/month on iOS and Android. Regardless of where you purchase, the subscription will apply to all linked Facebook and Instagram accounts in a user’s Accounts Center. As is the case for many online subscriptions, the iOS and Android pricing take into account the fees that Apple and Google charge through respective purchasing policies. Until March 1, 2024, the initial subscription covers all linked accounts in a user’s Accounts Center. However, beginning March 1, 2024, an additional fee of €6/month on the web and €8/month on iOS and Android will apply for each additional account listed in a user’s Account Center.\nWhy Are We Doing This?\nWe believe in an ad-supported internet, which gives people access to personalised products and services regardless of their economic status. It also allows small businesses to reach potential customers, grow their business and create new markets, driving growth in the European economy. And like other companies we’ll continue to advocate for an ad-supported internet, even with our new subscription offering in the EU, EEA and Switzerland.  But we respect the spirit and purpose of these evolving European regulations, and are committed to complying with them.\nWe announced in August our intention to move people in the EU, EEA and Switzerland to the GDPR legal basis of “Consent” for the purpose of processing data collected on our own platforms for advertising purposes. We made that change to address a number of evolving and emerging regulatory requirements in the region. This includes how our lead data protection regulator in the EU, the Irish Data Protection Commission, is interpreting GDPR following a recent ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) and anticipating the entry into force of the Digital Markets Act (DMA).\nThe option for people to purchase a subscription for no ads balances the requirements of European regulators while giving users choice and allowing Meta to continue serving all people in the EU, EEA and Switzerland. In its ruling, the CJEU expressly recognised that a subscription model, like the one we are announcing, is a valid form of consent for an ads funded service.\nIf you choose to continue to use our products for free, your experience will stay the same – and that experience will continue to be supported by the tools and settings that we have created to empower people to control their ads experience. These include Ad Preferences, which offers a range of controls that enable you to influence the ads you see as well as the data used to inform these ads, including  activity information from ad partners. We also have tools in our product that explain “Why am I seeing this ad?”, as well as how people can manage their ad experience.\nMeanwhile, advertisers will be able to continue running personalised advertising campaigns in Europe to reach those who choose to continue to receive a free, ad-supported online service. Going forward, we will continue to invest to build new tools that preserve the value that both people and businesses get out of personalised advertising, while allowing users to control their ads experience on our platforms.  The subscription for no ads will be available for people aged 18 and up, and we’re continuing to explore how to provide teens with a useful and responsible ad experience given this evolving regulatory landscape.\nThis new subscription model has been factored into our most recently announced business outlook and guidance. This post contains forward-looking statements, including about Meta’s business outlook and the evolving regulatory landscape. You should not rely on these statements as predictions of future events. Additional information regarding potential risks and uncertainties about our business and financial results can be found in our most recent Form 10-Q. Meta undertakes no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.",

    "content": "Later this month, the European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA), one of the most comprehensive pieces of internet regulation, will begin to fully apply to Facebook, Instagram and a number of other tech platforms and services. It is a big deal not just for European tech companies but for all tech companies that operate in the EU, and it will have a significant impact on the experiences Europeans have when they open their phones or fire up their laptops.\nMeta has long advocated for a harmonised regulatory regime that effectively protects people’s rights online, while continuing to enable innovation. For this reason, we welcome the ambition for greater transparency, accountability and user empowerment that sits at the heart of regulations like the DSA, GDPR, and the ePrivacy Directive. The DSA in particular provides greater clarity on the roles and responsibilities of online platforms and it is right to seek to hold large platforms like ours to account through things like reporting and auditing, rather than attempting to micromanage individual pieces of content.\nWe’ve been working hard since the DSA came into force last November to respond to these new rules and adapt the existing safety and integrity systems and processes we have in place in many of the areas regulated by the DSA. We assembled one of the largest cross-functional teams in our history, with over 1,000 people currently working on the DSA, to develop solutions to the DSA’s requirements. These include measures to increase transparency about how our systems work, and to give people more options to tailor their experiences on Facebook and Instagram. We have also established a new, independent compliance function to help us meet our regulatory obligations on an ongoing basis.\nBuilding on Our Industry-leading Ads Transparency and Protections\nWe were the first platform to put in place ads transparency tools and, for many years, we’ve provided industry-leading transparency for social issue, electoral and political ads. We are now building on that by expanding our Ad Library to display and archive all ads that target people in the EU, along with dates the ad ran, the parameters used for targeting (e.g., age, gender, location), who was served the ad, and more. These ads will be stored in our public Ad Library for a year, so anyone, anywhere, can better understand every ad that’s run in the EU.\nAs part of our continued work to keep our apps age-appropriate for teens, we’ve also made changes to their ads experience on our platforms. Since February, teens aged 13-17 globally no longer see advertising based on their activity on our apps — like following certain Instagram posts or Facebook pages. Age and location is now the only information about teens that advertisers can use to show them ads.\nGiving People More Information About How Our Platforms Work\nWe’re providing an unprecedented level of insight into how our AI systems rank content by releasing 22 system cards for Facebook and Instagram. These cards provide information about how our AI systems rank content for Feed, Reels, Stories, and other surfaces; some of the predictions each system makes to determine what content might be most relevant to people; and the options available to help customise an experience on Facebook and Instagram. These build on our long-standing “Why Am I Seeing This” feature, which allows people to see details directly in our apps about why our systems predicted that specific content would be relevant to them, and the types of activity and inputs that may have led to that prediction.\nWe’re also rolling out two new tools for researchers – the Meta Content Library and API. The library includes publicly available content from Pages, Posts, Groups and Events on Facebook, as well as publicly available content from creator and business accounts on Instagram. Researchers will be able to search, explore, and filter the publicly available content on a graphical User Interface (UI) or through a programmatic API. These tools will provide the most comprehensive access to publicly-available content across Facebook and Instagram of any research tool we have built to date.\nGiving People More Control Over Their Experiences on Facebook and Instagram\nAs well as additional transparency, we’re also providing people with more options to help tailor what they see on Facebook and Instagram. I’ve written previously about our AI ranking and recommendation processes, which help you see content we think you’ll find most meaningful and reduce the distribution of problematic content, so you’re less likely to come across it. We’re now giving our European community the option to view and discover content on Reels, Stories, Search and other parts of Facebook and Instagram that is not ranked by Meta using these systems. For example, on Facebook and Instagram, users will have the option to view Stories and Reels only from people they follow, ranked in chronological order, newest to oldest. They will also be able to view Search results based only on the words they enter, rather than personalised specifically to them based on their previous activity and personal interests.\nFor a number of years, in addition to reporting options for content that might violate our Community Standards and Guidelines, we’ve also had dedicated reporting tools for illegal content. We’ve now made those tools even easier for people to access. And while we already notify people when we remove a piece of their content, and typically give them the chance to appeal, we’ll now provide this information to people in the EU for a broader range of content moderation decisions. This includes when we apply feature limits to people’s accounts and when we restrict content for violating local law.\nThe Future of Harmonised Regulation\nFrom early on, we’ve been supportive of the objectives of the DSA and the creation of a regulatory regime in Europe that minimises harm effectively, protects and empowers people, and upholds their fundamental rights. The hard work of creating these pioneering new rules has come to an end, and the process of implementing them has begun. In this new regulatory environment, it is critical that the DSA now maintains its primacy over existing and new national laws, to protect the clarity it has created for services, maintain consistency in the way tech companies are held to account, and preserve the harmonious way people experience our platforms across the region. A strong and open digital single market is of vital importance to the competitiveness of Europe as a whole, and we will continue to work closely with European policymakers and regulators in support of this shared vision.",

    "content": "Rarely, if ever, do today’s online threats target one single technology platform – instead, they follow people across the internet. We go to great lengths to keep our apps safe for people and help raise our collective defenses across the internet. Today’s security and integrity updates provide an under-the-hood view into our defense strategy and the latest news on how we build it into products like our new app Threads and generative AI systems.\nIn the decade since we first began publishing transparency reports, technology companies and researchers have learned a great deal about how online public spaces can be abused by malicious actors. A key lesson for us has been that transparency across our industry has positive cascading effects on our collective ability to respond to new threats – from continuous pressure on malicious groups through takedowns and public exposure to government sanctions as well as stronger product defenses. Today’s updates are a good window into how this works in practice.\nTaking Down Two of the Largest Known Covert Influence Operations\nChina: We recently took down thousands of accounts and Pages that were part of the largest known cross-platform covert influence operation in the world. It targeted more than 50 apps, including Facebook, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), YouTube, TikTok, Reddit, Pinterest, Medium, Blogspot, LiveJournal, VKontakte, Vimeo, and dozens of smaller platforms and forums. For the first time, we were able to tie this activity together to confirm it was part of one operation known in the security community as Spamouflage and link it to individuals associated with Chinese law enforcement. See details in our Q2 Adversarial Threat report.\nRussia: We also blocked thousands of malicious website domains as well as attempts to run fake accounts and Pages on our platforms connected to the Russian operation known as Doppelganger that we first disrupted a year ago. This operation was focused on mimicking websites of mainstream news outlets and government entities to post fake articles aimed at weakening support for Ukraine. It has now expanded beyond initially targeting France, Germany and Ukraine to also include the US and Israel. This is the largest and the most aggressively-persistent Russian-origin operation we’ve taken down since 2017. In addition to new threat research, we’re also publishing our enforcement and policy recommendations for addressing the abuse of the global domain name registration system.\nExamining Impact of Disrupting Hate Networks\nWe first began using what we call Strategic Network Disruptions in 2017 to tackle covert influence operations from Russia. As it proved to be an effective instrument in our toolbox, we expanded it to other issue areas, including hate networks, cyber espionage and mass reporting. But because we know that malicious groups keep evolving their tactics across the internet, we also continue to ask ourselves: do these strategies still work and how can we improve them?\nOur team of researchers recently published a study of the effects of six network disruptions of banned hate-based organizations on Facebook. Their research found de-platforming these entities through network disruptions can help make the ecosystem less hospitable for designated dangerous organizations. While people closest to the core audience of these hate groups exhibit signs of backlash in the short-term, evidence suggests they reduce their engagement with the network and with hateful content over time. It also suggests that our strategies can reduce the ability of hate organizations to successfully operate online.\nBuilding Threads and Generative AI Tools\nWhile these network takedowns are impactful, they are just one tool in our broader defense against adversarial groups targeting people across the internet. Our investigations and enforcements power what we call a virtuous cycle of defense – improving our scaled systems and how we build new products.\nThreads: From the beginning, our integrity enforcement systems and policies developed for Instagram, and other apps, have been wired into how we built Threads. You can think of it as Threads being built on top of an established, global infrastructure powering multiple apps at once. This means that our security efforts, like tackling covert influence operations, apply to Threads just as they do to Facebook and Instagram. In fact, within 24 hours of Threads launching, we detected and blocked attempts to establish a presence on Threads by accounts linked to an influence operation we took down in the past.\nWe’ve also rolled out additional transparency features on Threads, including labeling state-controlled media and showing additional information about accounts so that people can know, for example, if accounts may have changed their names. We know that adversarial behaviors will keep evolving as the Threads app continues to mature, and so will we, to stay ahead of these threats.\nGenerative AI: Openness and cross-society collaboration are even more critical when it comes to rapidly evolving technologies like generative AI. In addition to extensive internal “red teaming” where our internal teams take on the role of adversaries to hunt for flaws, we recently brought our generative AI model to DEFCON — the largest hacker conference in the world. We joined our peers at Google, NVIDIA, OpenAI and others to stress test our different models as part of the first-ever public Generative Red Team Challenge.\nOver 2,200 researchers, including hundreds of students and organizations traditionally left out of the early stages of technological change, came together to hunt for bugs and vulnerabilities in these systems. According to the organizers of this challenge, they engaged in over 17,000 conversations with generative AI systems to probe for unintended behaviors – from bad math calculations to misinformation to providing bad user security practices. This open red team challenge was supported by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, the National Science Foundation, and the Congressional AI Caucus. Our hope is that early focus on establishing best practices for this emerging generative AI space will result in safer systems in the long term.\nWe believe that openness is the key to tackling some of the biggest challenges we collectively face online. Transparency reports, academic research, and other measures to innovate openly and stress-test our systems help our industry to learn from each other, improve our respective systems, and keep people safe across the internet.\nYou can find our quarterly integrity reports on Meta’s Transparency Center.",

    "content": "Today, we are announcing that in the UK, France and Germany we will deprecate Facebook News – a dedicated tab on Facebook in the bookmarks section that spotlights news – in early December.\nThis is part of an ongoing effort to better align our investments to our products and services people value the most. As a company, we have to focus our time and resources on things people tell us they want to see more of on the platform, including short form video. We know that people don’t come to Facebook for news and political content – they come to connect with people and discover new opportunities, passions and interests. News makes up less than 3% of what people around the world see in their Facebook feed, so news discovery is a small part of the Facebook experience for the vast majority of people.\nThe changes affecting the Facebook News feature will not otherwise impact Meta’s products and services in these countries. People will still be able to view links to news articles on Facebook. European news publishers will continue to have access to their Facebook accounts and Pages, where they can post links to their stories and direct people to their websites in the way any other individual or organization can. News organizations can also still leverage products like Reels and our ads system to reach broader audiences and drive people to their website, where they keep 100% of the revenue derived from outbound links on Facebook.\nWhile we’ll be deprecating Facebook News in these countries, we will honour our obligations under all existing Facebook News deals with publishers in the UK, France and Germany until they expire. However, to ensure that we continue to invest in those products and services that drive user engagement, we will not enter into new commercial deals for news content on Facebook News in these countries and do not expect to offer new Facebook products specifically for news publishers in the future.\nOur Commitment to Connecting People to Reliable Information\nThis does not impact our commitment to connecting people to reliable information on our platforms. We work with independent third-party fact-checkers – certified through the non-partisan International Fact-Checking Network – who review and rate viral misinformation on our apps. We have built the largest global fact-checking network of any platform by partnering with more than 90 independent fact-checking organisations around the world who review content in more than 60 languages. We have contributed more than $100 million to programs supporting our fact-checking efforts since 2016 to combat the spread of misinformation and we will continue to invest in this area.",

    "content": "Update on June 14, 2024 at 7:30am PT:\nWe’re disappointed by the request from the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), our lead regulator, on behalf of the European DPAs, to delay training our large language models (LLMs) using public content shared by adults on Facebook and Instagram  — particularly since we incorporated regulatory feedback and the European DPAs have been informed since March. This is a step backwards for European innovation, competition in AI development and further delays bringing the benefits of AI to people in Europe.\nWe remain highly confident that our approach complies with European laws and regulations. AI training is not unique to our services, and we’re more transparent than many of our industry counterparts.\nWe are committed to bringing Meta AI, along with the models that power it, to more people around the world, including in Europe. But, put simply, without including local information we’d only be able to offer people a second-rate experience. This means we aren’t able to launch Meta AI in Europe at the moment.\nWe will continue to work collaboratively with the DPC so that people in Europe have access to – and are properly served by – the same level of AI innovation as the rest of the world.\nThis delay will also enable us to address specific requests we have received from the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), our UK regulator, ahead of starting the training.\nOriginally published on June 10, 2024 at 6am PT:\nFor years, we’ve been working hard to build the next generation of AI features across our family of apps and devices. And this year, we plan to expand AI at Meta – our collection of generative AI features and experiences along with the models that power them – to people in Europe.\nAI at Meta is already available in other parts of the world. This includes Llama – our state-of-the-art open source large language model – and the Meta AI assistant – the most intelligent AI assistant you can use for free. To properly serve our European communities, the models that power AI at Meta need to be trained on relevant information that reflects the diverse languages, geography and cultural references of the people in Europe who will use them. To do this, we want to train our large language models that power AI features using the content that people in the EU have chosen to share publicly on Meta’s products and services.\nIf we don’t train our models on the public content that Europeans share on our services and others, such as public posts or comments, then models and the AI features they power won’t accurately understand important regional languages, cultures or trending topics on social media. We believe that Europeans will be ill-served by AI models that are not informed by Europe’s rich cultural, social and historical contributions.\nMeta is not the first company to do this – we are following the example set by others, including Google and OpenAI, both of which have already used data from European users to train AI. Our approach is more transparent and offers easier controls than many of our industry counterparts already training their models on similar publicly available information.\nWe Are Committed to Developing AI Responsibly and Transparently\nBuilding this technology comes with the responsibility to develop best practices and policies that adhere to local laws and regulations. In line with this commitment, we are in consultation with our lead privacy regulator in the EU, the Irish Data Protection Commission, and have incorporated their feedback to date to ensure that the way we train AI at Meta complies with EU privacy laws. We also continue to work with experts like academics and consumer advocates to ensure that what we build follows best practices.\nWe want to be transparent with people so they are aware of their rights and the controls available to them. That’s why, since 22 May, we’ve sent more than two billion in-app notifications and emails to people in Europe to explain what we’re doing. These notifications contain a link to an objection form that gives people the opportunity to object to their data being used in our AI modelling efforts.\nIn the development of our notifications, we reviewed the approach of our industry counterparts as well as our previous policy update notifications. As a result, we made our form easier to find, read and use than those offered by other companies offering generative AI in the EU: it can be accessed with just three clicks and requires fewer fields to be completed. To further aid understanding, we also designed it to be more accessible to people with a lower reading age, even though we are not training our Llama models on content from accounts of Europeans under the age of 18.\nWe are honouring all European objections. If an objection form is submitted before Llama training begins, then that person’s data won’t be used to train those models, either in the current training round or in the future.\nTo be clear, our goal is to build useful features based on information that people over 18 in Europe have chosen to share publicly on Meta’s products and services, such as public posts, public comments, or public photos and their captions. Models may be trained on people’s publicly shared posts, but it’s not a database of each person’s information nor is it designed to identify any individual. Rather, these models are built by looking at people’s information to identify patterns, like understanding colloquial phrases or local references, not to identify a specific person or their information.\nAs we’ve said, we do not use people’s private messages with friends and family to train our AI systems. In the future, we anticipate using other content, such as interactions with AI features or chats with a business using AI at Meta AI.\nLike many industry counterparts that have come before us in training large language models using Europeans’ data, to do this work in the EU, we will rely on a legal basis of ‘Legitimate Interests’ to comply with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We believe this legal basis is the most appropriate balance for processing public data at the scale necessary to train AI models, while respecting people’s rights.\nWe feel a responsibility to build AI that is not forced on Europeans but actually built for them. To do that while respecting European users’ choices, we think the right thing to do is to let them know of our plans and give them the choice to tell us if they don’t want to participate. And we believe the best way to strike this balance is for companies to be transparent about the information their AIs are using while providing users with prominent controls to opt-out of those uses if that is their preference. This is precisely what we have done.\nEurope is at a Crossroads\nAs Europe stands at the threshold of society’s next major technological evolution, some activists are advocating extreme approaches to data and AI. Let’s be clear: those positions don’t reflect European law, and they amount to an argument that Europeans shouldn’t have access to — or be properly served by — AI that the rest of the world has. We deeply disagree with that outcome.\nAs one of the most influential regions in the world, Europe has the potential to be a competitive leader in AI innovation. But questions still remain: will Europeans have equal access to groundbreaking AI? Will AI experiences reflect our culture, humour and history? Or does Europe want to watch as the rest of the world benefits from truly innovative technology that builds community and drives growth?\nAI is the next frontier in innovation. We’re living in one of the most exciting technological moments in a generation, where breakthroughs are happening in front of our eyes and the possibilities are endless. And at Meta, we want Europeans to be part of it.",

    "content": "In the early days of high-performance computing, the major tech companies of the day each invested heavily in developing their own closed source versions of Unix. It was hard to imagine at the time that any other approach could develop such advanced software. Eventually though, open source Linux gained popularity – initially because it allowed developers to modify its code however they wanted and was more affordable, and over time because it became more advanced, more secure, and had a broader ecosystem supporting more capabilities than any closed Unix. Today, Linux is the industry standard foundation for both cloud computing and the operating systems that run most mobile devices – and we all benefit from superior products because of it.\nI believe that AI will develop in a similar way. Today, several tech companies are developing leading closed models. But open source is quickly closing the gap. Last year, Llama 2 was only comparable to an older generation of models behind the frontier. This year, Llama 3 is competitive with the most advanced models and leading in some areas. Starting next year, we expect future Llama models to become the most advanced in the industry. But even before that, Llama is already leading on openness, modifiability, and cost efficiency.\nToday we’re taking the next steps towards open source AI becoming the industry standard. We’re releasing Llama 3.1 405B, the first frontier-level open source AI model, as well as new and improved Llama 3.1 70B and 8B models. In addition to having significantly better cost/performance relative to closed models, the fact that the 405B model is open will make it the best choice for fine-tuning and distilling smaller models.\nBeyond releasing these models, we’re working with a range of companies to grow the broader ecosystem. Amazon, Databricks, and NVIDIA are launching full suites of services to support developers fine-tuning and distilling their own models. Innovators like Groq have built low-latency, low-cost inference serving for all the new models. The models will be available on all major clouds including AWS, Azure, Google, Oracle, and more. Companies like Scale.AI, Dell, Deloitte, and others are ready to help enterprises adopt Llama and train custom models with their own data. As the community grows and more companies develop new services, we can collectively make Llama the industry standard and bring the benefits of AI to everyone.\nMeta is committed to open source AI. I’ll outline why I believe open source is the best development stack for you, why open sourcing Llama is good for Meta, and why open source AI is good for the world and therefore a platform that will be around for the long term.\nWhy Open Source AI Is Good for Developers\nWhen I talk to developers, CEOs, and government officials across the world, I usually hear several themes:\nWe need to train, fine-tune, and distill our own models. Every organization has different needs that are best met with models of different sizes that are trained or fine-tuned with their specific data. On-device tasks and classification tasks require small models, while more complicated tasks require larger models. Now you’ll be able to take the most advanced Llama models, continue training them with your own data and then distill them down to a model of your optimal size – without us or anyone else seeing your data.\nWe need to control our own destiny and not get locked into a closed vendor. Many organizations don’t want to depend on models they cannot run and control themselves. They don’t want closed model providers to be able to change their model, alter their terms of use, or even stop serving them entirely. They also don’t want to get locked into a single cloud that has exclusive rights to a model. Open source enables a broad ecosystem of companies with compatible toolchains that you can move between easily.\nWe need to protect our data. Many organizations handle sensitive data that they need to secure and can’t send to closed models over cloud APIs. Other organizations simply don’t trust the closed model providers with their data. Open source addresses these issues by enabling you to run the models wherever you want. It is well-accepted that open source software tends to be more secure because it is developed more transparently.\nWe need a model that is efficient and affordable to run. Developers can run inference on Llama 3.1 405B on their own infra at roughly 50% the cost of using closed models like GPT-4o, for both user-facing and offline inference tasks.\nWe want to invest in the ecosystem that’s going to be the standard for the long term. Lots of people see that open source is advancing at a faster rate than closed models, and they want to build their systems on the architecture that will give them the greatest advantage long term.\nWhy Open Source AI Is Good for Meta\nMeta’s business model is about building the best experiences and services for people. To do this, we must ensure that we always have access to the best technology, and that we’re not locking into a competitor’s closed ecosystem where they can restrict what we build.\nOne of my formative experiences has been building our services constrained by what Apple will let us build on their platforms. Between the way they tax developers, the arbitrary rules they apply, and all the product innovations they block from shipping, it’s clear that Meta and many other companies would be freed up to build much better services for people if we could build the best versions of our products and competitors were not able to constrain what we could build. On a philosophical level, this is a major reason why I believe so strongly in building open ecosystems in AI and AR/VR for the next generation of computing.\nPeople often ask if I’m worried about giving up a technical advantage by open sourcing Llama, but I think this misses the big picture for a few reasons:\nFirst, to ensure that we have access to the best technology and aren’t locked into a closed ecosystem over the long term, Llama needs to develop into a full ecosystem of tools, efficiency improvements, silicon optimizations, and other integrations. If we were the only company using Llama, this ecosystem wouldn’t develop and we’d fare no better than the closed variants of Unix.\nSecond, I expect AI development will continue to be very competitive, which means that open sourcing any given model isn’t giving away a massive advantage over the next best models at that point in time. The path for Llama to become the industry standard is by being consistently competitive, efficient, and open generation after generation.\nThird, a key difference between Meta and closed model providers is that selling access to AI models isn’t our business model. That means openly releasing Llama doesn’t undercut our revenue, sustainability, or ability to invest in research like it does for closed providers. (This is one reason several closed providers consistently lobby governments against open source.)\nFinally, Meta has a long history of open source projects and successes. We’ve saved billions of dollars by releasing our server, network, and data center designs with Open Compute Project and having supply chains standardize on our designs. We benefited from the ecosystem’s innovations by open sourcing leading tools like PyTorch, React, and many more tools. This approach has consistently worked for us when we stick with it over the long term.\nWhy Open Source AI Is Good for the World\nI believe that open source is necessary for a positive AI future. AI has more potential than any other modern technology to increase human productivity, creativity, and quality of life – and to accelerate economic growth while unlocking progress in medical and scientific research. Open source will ensure that more people around the world have access to the benefits and opportunities of AI, that power isn’t concentrated in the hands of a small number of companies, and that the technology can be deployed more evenly and safely across society.\nThere is an ongoing debate about the safety of open source AI models, and my view is that open source AI will be safer than the alternatives. I think governments will conclude it’s in their interest to support open source because it will make the world more prosperous and safer.\nMy framework for understanding safety is that we need to protect against two categories of harm: unintentional and intentional. Unintentional harm is when an AI system may cause harm even when it was not the intent of those running it to do so. For example, modern AI models may inadvertently give bad health advice. Or, in more futuristic scenarios, some worry that models may unintentionally self-replicate or hyper-optimize goals to the detriment of humanity. Intentional harm is when a bad actor uses an AI model with the goal of causing harm.\nIt’s worth noting that unintentional harm covers the majority of concerns people have around AI – ranging from what influence AI systems will have on the billions of people who will use them to most of the truly catastrophic science fiction scenarios for humanity. On this front, open source should be significantly safer since the systems are more transparent and can be widely scrutinized. Historically, open source software has been more secure for this reason. Similarly, using Llama with its safety systems like Llama Guard will likely be safer and more secure than closed models. For this reason, most conversations around open source AI safety focus on intentional harm.\nOur safety process includes rigorous testing and red-teaming to assess whether our models are capable of meaningful harm, with the goal of mitigating risks before release. Since the models are open, anyone is capable of testing for themselves as well. We must keep in mind that these models are trained by information that’s already on the internet, so the starting point when considering harm should be whether a model can facilitate more harm than information that can quickly be retrieved from Google or other search results.\nWhen reasoning about intentional harm, it’s helpful to distinguish between what individual or small scale actors may be able to do as opposed to what large scale actors like nation states with vast resources may be able to do.\nAt some point in the future, individual bad actors may be able to use the intelligence of AI models to fabricate entirely new harms from the information available on the internet. At this point, the balance of power will be critical to AI safety. I think it will be better to live in a world where AI is widely deployed so that larger actors can check the power of smaller bad actors. This is how we’ve managed security on our social networks – our more robust AI systems identify and stop threats from less sophisticated actors who often use smaller scale AI systems. More broadly, larger institutions deploying AI at scale will promote security and stability across society. As long as everyone has access to similar generations of models – which open source promotes – then governments and institutions with more compute resources will be able to check bad actors with less compute.\nThe next question is how the US and democratic nations should handle the threat of states with massive resources like China. The United States’ advantage is decentralized and open innovation. Some people argue that we must close our models to prevent China from gaining access to them, but my view is that this will not work and will only disadvantage the US and its allies. Our adversaries are great at espionage, stealing models that fit on a thumb drive is relatively easy, and most tech companies are far from operating in a way that would make this more difficult. It seems most likely that a world of only closed models results in a small number of big companies plus our geopolitical adversaries having access to leading models, while startups, universities, and small businesses miss out on opportunities. Plus, constraining American innovation to closed development increases the chance that we don’t lead at all. Instead, I think our best strategy is to build a robust open ecosystem and have our leading companies work closely with our government and allies to ensure they can best take advantage of the latest advances and achieve a sustainable first-mover advantage over the long term.\nWhen you consider the opportunities ahead, remember that most of today’s leading tech companies and scientific research are built on open source software. The next generation of companies and research will use open source AI if we collectively invest in it. That includes startups just getting off the ground as well as people in universities and countries that may not have the resources to develop their own state-of-the-art AI from scratch.\nThe bottom line is that open source AI represents the world’s best shot at harnessing this technology to create the greatest economic opportunity and security for everyone.\nWith past Llama models, Meta developed them for ourselves and then released them, but didn’t focus much on building a broader ecosystem. We’re taking a different approach with this release. We’re building teams internally to enable as many developers and partners as possible to use Llama, and we’re actively building partnerships so that more companies in the ecosystem can offer unique functionality to their customers as well.\nI believe the Llama 3.1 release will be an inflection point in the industry where most developers begin to primarily use open source, and I expect that approach to only grow from here. I hope you’ll join us on this journey to bring the benefits of AI to everyone in the world.\nYou can access the models now at llama.meta.com.",

This five-month notice period should give people time to complete any current projects they are using it for and, if eligible, to get up to speed with our new research tools, Meta Content Library and API, or others that serve their needs.\nPeople from qualified academic or nonprofit institutions who are pursuing scientific or public interest research can apply for access to these tools through the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) at the University of Michigan.\nMeta Content Library and API are designed to give researchers access to comprehensive, publicly-accessible content across Facebook and Instagram. In April, researchers will be able to download publicly-accessible content posted by widely-known figures and organizations, and ‘comments’ will be added as a new data type within ICPSR’s virtual clean room. We will continue to gather feedback from researchers and add new features and datasets over time.\nUpdate on February 15, 2024 at 7:00AM PT:\nWe want to make more data from our platforms available to academic researchers so they can pursue public interest research, while doing so in a way that respects both people’s privacy and our compliance obligations.\nIn the months since we rolled out our Meta Content Library tool we’ve been gathering feedback from researchers to ensure the sort of publicly-accessible data they need is available to them in a way that’s effective for their research. Based on that feedback, we are adding some new data and features.\nOne of the biggest requests was to make content from public figures more accessible to researchers so it is easier to study the impact their activity on Facebook and Instagram has on politics, society and culture. So, in the coming weeks, we’re making it possible for researchers to download certain publicly-accessible content posted by widely-known figures and organizations. This data will be accessible in a downloadable CSV format through the Meta Content Library user interface and won’t require access through a virtual clean room.\nIn the next few months, we’ll also be adding ‘comments’ as a new data type within the Meta Content Library. This will help researchers study how people around the world receive, discuss and reinterpret content across publicly-accessible pages and posts. We’ll be starting with comments from public forums on Facebook, which researchers will be able to analyze within ICPSR’s virtual clean room.\nOur Third Party Fact-Checking partners will also have access to Meta Content Library to help them investigate and debunk misinformation. We hope these powerful search capabilities will help them do this more efficiently, particularly during key moments such as elections.\nOriginally published on November 21, 2023 at 3:00AM PT:\nTo understand the impact social media apps like Facebook and Instagram have on the world, it’s important to support rigorous, independent research. That’s why Meta has been committed to an open and privacy-protective approach to research for many years, including making tools available to support public interest research, such as the US 2020 studies.\nOver the past few months we gave Beta access to our new Meta Content Library and API tools. After multiple rounds of feedback with researchers and other stakeholders, we are now in a position to roll these tools out more broadly.\nMeta Content Library & API\nOur Meta Content Library and API tools provide access to near real-time public content from Pages, Posts, Groups and Events on Facebook, as well as from creator and business accounts on Instagram. Details about the content, such as the number of reactions, shares, comments and, for the first time, post view counts are also available. Researchers can search, explore and filter that content on both a graphical User Interface (UI) or through a programmatic API.\nTogether, these tools provide the most comprehensive access to publicly-available content across Facebook and Instagram of any research tool we have built to date. They also help us meet new regulatory requirements, data-sharing and transparency compliance obligations. Introducing these tools to researchers early in the development process gave us the opportunity to improve them before making them more widely available. We will continue to make improvements as we collect more feedback from researchers.\nIndividuals from qualified institutions pursuing scientific or public interest research topics will be able to apply for access to these tools through partners with deep expertise in secure data sharing for research, starting with the University of Michigan’s Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research. This is a first-of-its-kind partnership that will enable researchers to analyze data from the API in ICPSR’s Social Media Archive’s (SOMAR) Virtual Data Enclave.\nLast year, in collaboration with Raj Chetty and Harvard’s Opportunity Insights Program, we released a landmark study to measure the drivers of economic mobility in the US using information from 21 billion friendships on Facebook, which found that social connections play an important role in helping communities rise out of poverty.\nWe’re now expanding this research program with Harvard to better understand the drivers of economic mobility around the world by using insights from our platform on the dynamics of social networks, as well as publicly available data on socioeconomics and schools. We plan to examine cross-class friendships across the United Kingdom in collaboration with experts at the Behavioural Insights Team, Royal Society of Arts, Stripe Partners and Neighbourly Lab.\nAs well as expanding to more countries, we also plan to do more research into the role social connections play in economic opportunity including business creation, attending college, and getting a job. Building on our work looking at how social connections benefit people, we will continue to study how social networks help communities recover from crises and help displaced populations and migrants.",

    "content": "We want teens to have safe, age-appropriate experiences on our apps. We’ve developed more than 30 tools and features to help support teens and their parents, and we’ve spent over a decade developing policies and technology to address content and behavior that breaks our rules.\nEarlier this month, we announced new steps to further limit teens’ ability to see potentially sensitive content on Instagram and Facebook, as well as new nudges to encourage teens to close Instagram at night. Today, we’re announcing more steps to help protect teens from unwanted contact, and to make it simpler for parents to shape their teens’ online experiences.\nStricter Private Messaging Settings for Teens\nTo help protect teens from unwanted contact on Instagram, we restrict adults over the age of 19 from messaging teens who don’t follow them, and we limit the type and number of direct messages (DMs) people can send to someone who doesn’t follow them to one text-only message.\nToday we’re announcing an additional step to help protect teens from unwanted contact by turning off their ability to receive DMs from anyone they don’t follow or aren’t connected to on Instagram – including other teens – by default.\nUnder this new default setting, teens can only be messaged or added to group chats by people they already follow or are connected to, helping teens and their parents feel even more confident that they won’t hear from people they don’t know in their DMs. Teens in supervised accounts will need to get their parent’s permission to change this setting (more below).\nThis default setting will apply to all teens under the age of 16 (or under 18 in certain countries). Those already on Instagram will see a notification at the top of their Feed letting them know we’re making these changes to their message settings.\nWe’re also making these changes to teens’ default settings on Messenger, where under 16s (or under 18 in certain countries) will only receive messages from Facebook friends, or people they’re connected to through phone contacts, for example.\nIn addition, we’re planning to launch a new feature designed to help protect teens from seeing unwanted and potentially inappropriate images in their messages from people they’re already connected to, and to discourage them from sending these types of images themselves. We’ll have more to share on this feature, which will also work in encrypted chats, later this year.\nHelping Parents Shape Their Teens’ Online Experiences\nWe first launched parental supervision on Instagram in March 2022 and since then have continued to add new features to help involve parents more in their teens’ online experiences. These include the ability for parents to set time limits and schedule breaks, to understand when their teen blocks or shares they’ve reported someone, and to be notified when their teen changes their settings.\nNow, parents using supervision will be prompted to approve or deny their teens’ (under 16) requests to change their default safety and privacy settings to a less strict state – rather than just being notified of the change. For example, if a teen using supervision tries to change their account from private to public, change their Sensitive Content Control from “Less” to “Standard”, or – now – tries to change their DM settings to hear from people they’re not already following or connected to, their parent will receive a notification prompting them to approve or deny the request.\nAs with all our parental supervision tools, this new feature is intended to help facilitate offline conversations between parents and their teens, as they navigate their online lives together and decide what’s best for them and their family.\nLarry Magid, CEO of ConnectSafely, said:\n“Empowering parents to approve or deny requests to change their teen’s default safety and privacy settings gives parents the tools they need to help protect their teens, while at the same time respecting their teens’ privacy and ability to communicate with their friends and family.”",

    "content": "Financial sextortion is a horrific crime that can have devastating consequences. Our teams have deep experience in fighting this crime and work closely with experts to recognize the tactics scammers use, understand how they evolve and develop effective ways to help stop them. Like many crimes, financial sextortion crosses borders, and over recent years there’s been a growing trend of scammers — largely driven by cybercriminals known as Yahoo Boys — targeting people across the internet, both with these and other types of scams. We’ve banned Yahoo Boys under Meta’s Dangerous Organizations and Individuals policy — one of our strictest policies — which means we remove Yahoo Boys’ accounts engaged in this criminal activity whenever we become aware of them.\nFollowing our recent Q1 2024 Adversarial Threat Report, today we are announcing the strategic network disruption of two sets of accounts in Nigeria that were affiliated with Yahoo Boys and were attempting to engage in financial sextortion scams.\nFirst, we removed around 63,000 Instagram accounts in Nigeria that attempted to directly engage in financial sextortion scams. These included a smaller coordinated network of around 2,500 accounts that we were able to link to a group of around 20 individuals. They targeted primarily adult men in the US and used fake accounts to mask their identities.\nWe found the coordinated network of around 2,500 accounts through a combination of new technical signals we’ve developed to help identify sextorters and in-depth investigations by our expert teams. The majority of these accounts had already been detected and disabled by our enforcement systems, and this investigation allowed us to remove the remaining accounts and understand more about the techniques being used to improve our automated detection.\nWhile our investigation showed that the majority of these scammers’ attempts were unsuccessful and mostly targeted adults, we did see some also attempt to target minors, and we’ve reported those accounts to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). Since these criminals don’t limit themselves to any one platform, we also share relevant information with other tech companies through the Tech Coalition’s Lantern program, so they can take action too.\nApplying lessons learned from taking down terrorist groups and coordinated inauthentic behavior, we used our identification of this coordinated network to help us identify more accounts in Nigeria that were attempting to engage in similar sextortion scams, bringing the total to around 63,000 accounts removed.\nSecond, we removed around 7,200 assets, including 1,300 Facebook accounts, 200 Facebook Pages and 5,700 Facebook Groups, also based in Nigeria, that were providing tips for conducting scams. Their efforts included offering to sell scripts and guides to use when scamming people, and sharing links to collections of photos to use when populating fake accounts.\nSince this disruption, our systems have been identifying and automatically blocking attempts from these groups to come back, and we continue to strengthen those systems to make them as effective as possible. We’ve also used the new tactics we observed to further improve our ability to detect accounts, Groups and Pages engaging in this activity.\nWhile these investigations and disruptions are critical, they’re just one part of our approach. We continue to support law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting these crimes, including by responding to valid legal requests for information and by alerting them when we become aware of someone at risk of imminent harm, in accordance with our terms of service and applicable law. We also fund and support NCMEC and the International Justice Mission to run Project Boost, a program that trains law enforcement agencies around the world in processing and acting on NCMEC reports. We’ve conducted several training sessions so far, including in Nigeria and the Cote d’Ivoire, with our most recent session taking place just last month.\nWe also want to help people recognize and avoid these scams, while making it as difficult as possible for the criminals behind them to succeed. It’s why we default teens under 16 (under 18 in certain countries) into stricter message settings so they can’t be messaged by anyone — even other teens — they’re not connected to, and show Safety Notices encouraging them to be cautious.\nWe also recently announced that we’ve developed new signals to identify accounts that are potentially engaging in sextortion, and are taking steps to help prevent these accounts from finding and interacting with teens. Finally, we’ve started testing our on-device nudity protection feature in Instagram DMs, which will blur images detected as containing nudity, encourage people to be cautious when sending sensitive images and direct people to safety tips and resources, including NCMEC’s Take It Down platform.\nThis is an adversarial space where criminals evolve to evade our ever-improving defenses. We will continue to focus on understanding how they operate so we can stay one step ahead, and will continue our vital cooperation with child safety experts, law enforcement and the tech industry to help disrupt these criminals across all the platforms they use.",

    "content": "Meta has been preparing for the EU Parliament elections for a long time. Last year, we activated a dedicated team to develop a tailored approach to help preserve the integrity of these elections on our platforms.\nWhile each election is unique, this work drew on key lessons we have learned from more than 200 elections around the world since 2016, as well as the regulatory framework set out under the Digital Services Act and our commitments in the EU Code of Practice on Disinformation. These lessons help us focus our teams, technologies, and investments so they will have the greatest impact.\nSince 2016, we’ve invested more than $20 billion into safety and security and quadrupled the size of our global team working in this area to around 40,000 people. This includes 15,000 content reviewers who review content across Facebook, Instagram and Threads in more than 70 languages — including all 24 official EU languages.\nOver the last eight years, we’ve rolled out industry-leading transparency tools for ads about social issues, elections or politics, developed comprehensive policies to prevent election interference and voter fraud, and built the largest third party fact-checking programme of any social media platform to help combat the spread of misinformation. More recently, we have committed to taking a responsible approach to new technologies like GenAI. We’ll be drawing on all of these resources in the run up to the election.\nAs the election approaches, we’ll also activate an EU-specific Elections Operations Center, bringing together experts from across the company from our intelligence, data science, engineering, research, operations, content policy and legal teams to identify potential threats and put specific mitigations in place across our apps and technologies in real time.\nHere are three key areas our teams will be focusing on:\nWe remove the most serious kinds of misinformation from Facebook, Instagram and Threads, such as content that could contribute to imminent violence or physical harm, or that is intended to suppress voting.\nFor content that doesn’t violate these particular policies, we work with independent fact-checking organisations — 26 partners across the EU covering 22 languages  — who review and rate content. We are currently expanding the programme in Europe with 3 new partners in Bulgaria, France, and Slovakia.\nWhen content is debunked by these fact checkers, we attach warning labels to the content and reduce its distribution in Feed so people are less likely to see it. Between July and December 2023, for example, over 68 million pieces of content viewed in the EU on Facebook and Instagram had fact checking labels. When a fact-checked label is placed on a post, 95% of people don’t click through to view it.\nAhead of the elections period, we will make it easier for all our fact-checking partners across the EU to find and rate content related to the elections because we recognize that speed is especially important during breaking news events. We’ll use keyword detection to group related content in one place, making it easy for fact-checkers to find. Our fact checking partners are also being onboarded to our new research tool, Meta Content Library, that has a powerful search capability to support them in their work.\nWe don’t allow ads that contain debunked content. We also don’t allow ads targeting the EU that discourage people from voting in the election; call into question the legitimacy of the election; contain premature claims of election victory; and call into question the legitimacy of the methods and processes of election, as well as its outcome. Our ads review process has several layers of analysis and detection, both before and after an ad goes live, which you can read more about here.\nWe are working with the European Fact-Checking Standards Network (EFCSN) on a project to help train fact-checkers across Europe on the best way to evaluate AI generated and digitally altered media, and on a media literacy campaign to raise public awareness of how to spot that type of content. We will begin accepting EFCSN certification as a prerequisite for consideration in the Meta fact checking program in Europe, in recognition of the strong standards it has established for the European fact checking community. Meta is also supporting The European Disability Forum to run a media literacy campaign ahead of EU Elections focusing on inclusion.\nWe define influence operations as coordinated efforts to manipulate or corrupt public debate for a strategic goal – what some may refer to as disinformation – and which may or may not include misinformation as a tactic. They can vary from covert campaigns that rely on fake identities (what we call coordinated inauthentic behaviour), to overt efforts by state-controlled media entities.\nTo counter covert influence operations, we’ve built specialised global teams to stop coordinated inauthentic behaviour and have investigated and taken down over 200 of these adversarial networks since 2017, something we publicly share as part of our Quarterly Threat Reports. This is a highly adversarial space where deceptive campaigns we take down continue to try to come back and evade detection by us and other platforms, which is why we continuously take action as we find further violating activity. In preparation, we conducted a session to focus on threats specifically associated with the EU Parliament elections.\nWe also label state-controlled media on Facebook, Instagram and Threads so that people know when content is from a publication that may be under the editorial control of a government. After we applied new and stronger enforcement to Russian state-controlled media, including blocking them in the EU and globally demoting their posts, the most recent research by Graphika shows posting volumes on their pages went down 55% and engagement levels were down 94% compared to pre-war levels, while “more than half of all Russian state media assets had stopped posting altogether.”\nCountering the Risks Related to the Abuse of GenAI Technologies\nOur Community Standards, and Ad Standards apply to all content, including content generated by AI, and we will take action against this type of content when it violates these policies. AI-generated content is also eligible to be reviewed and rated by our independent fact-checking partners. One of the rating options is Altered, which includes, “Faked, manipulated or transformed audio, video, or photos.” When it is rated as such, we label it and down-rank it in feed, so fewer people see it. We also don’t allow an ad to run if it’s been debunked.\nFor content that doesn’t violate our policies, we still believe it’s important for people to know when photorealistic content they’re seeing has been created using AI. We already label photorealistic images created using Meta AI, and we are building tools to label AI generated images from Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, Adobe, Midjourney, and Shutterstock that users post to Facebook, Instagram and Threads.\nWe will also be adding a feature for people to disclose when they share AI-generated video or audio so we can add a label to it, and we may apply penalties if they fail to do so. If we determine that digitally created or altered image, video or audio content creates a particularly high risk of materially deceiving the public on a matter of importance, we may add a more prominent label, so people have more information and context.\nAdvertisers who run ads related to social issues, elections or politics with Meta also have to disclose if they use a photorealistic image or video, or realistic sounding audio, that has been created or altered digitally, including with AI, in certain cases. That is in addition to our industry leading ad transparency, which includes a verification process to prove an advertiser is who they say they are and that they live in the EU; a “Paid for by” disclaimer to show who’s behind each ad; and our Ad Library, where everyone can see what ads are running, see information about targeting and find out how much was spent on them. Between July – December 2023 we removed 430,000 ads across the EU for failing to carry a disclaimer.\nSince AI-generated content appears across the internet, we’ve also been working with other companies in our industry on common standards and guidelines. We’re a member of the Partnership on AI, for example, and we recently signed on to the tech accord designed to combat the spread of deceptive AI content in the 2024 elections. This work is bigger than any one company & will require a huge effort across industry, government, & civil society.",

We are offering these choices to address the requirements of the DMA, which enter into force in March 2024.\nHelping People Understand the Choices They Will Be Able to Make\nOver the next few weeks, people will receive notifications that will inform them about their ability to choose  whether they would like to share information between our services. Some of the choices that users will be able to make include:\nInformation use between Facebook and Instagram: People who have already chosen to connect their Instagram and Facebook accounts will be able to choose either:\nto continue to connect their accounts through our Accounts Center so that their information will be used across their Instagram and Facebook accounts; or\nto manage their Instagram and Facebook accounts separately so that their information is no longer used across accounts.\nFurther details on how we will use information differently depending on the choices people can make can be found here.\nFacebook Messenger: People using Facebook Messenger can choose whether they wish to continue using Facebook Messenger with their Facebook account, or if they would prefer to create a stand-alone new Messenger account. People who choose to create a new Messenger account without their Facebook information will be able to use Messenger’s core service offering such as private messaging and chat, voice and video calling.\nFacebook Marketplace: People using Facebook Marketplace can choose between a Marketplace experience that uses their Facebook information or not. For people who choose to use their Facebook information for their Marketplace experience, the current Marketplace experience will remain. People who choose not to use their Facebook information for their Marketplace experience will still be able to browse listings and to buy and sell items, with key differences being that communication between buyers and sellers will be via email instead of Facebook Messenger.\nFacebook Gaming: People who play games on Facebook can choose between a gaming experience that uses their Facebook information or an experience without their Facebook information. People who choose to use their Facebook information for the games they play on Facebook will have features like multiplayer games, in-game purchases, and personalised game suggestions. People who choose not to use their Facebook information for the games they play on Facebook can play some single-player games.\nAds: People in the EU, EEA and Switzerland also have the ability to use Instagram and Facebook for free with ads, or subscribe to stop seeing ads. If people  subscribe to stop seeing ads, their information will not be used for ads. This choice rolled out in November 2023.\nBeyond these new choices, everyone using Facebook and Instagram services will continue to benefit from the extensive range of existing tools that we have built to give people choice over the information they share and how we process their data.\nMeta Is Committed to Complying With Evolving European Regulation\nThe DMA seeks to promote contestability and fairness in digital markets – an ambition that Meta supports. We are committed to continue working hard to ensure that Meta’s products in the EU comply with the DMA and deliver value to people – we have assembled a large cross-functional team staffed by senior employees from around the globe and across our entire family of apps to achieve that.",

    "content": "SAN FRANCISCO — California Attorney General Rob Bonta today co-led a bipartisan coalition of 33 attorneys general in filing a federal lawsuit against Meta Platforms, Inc. and affiliates (Meta). Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, the lawsuit alleges that Meta, among other things, designed and deployed harmful features on Instagram and Facebook that addict children and teens to their mental and physical detriment. The attorneys general are seeking injunctive and monetary relief to address Meta’s misconduct. As part of this coordinated effort, eight attorneys general announced filing lawsuits against Meta today in their respective state courts. The federal and state complaints are the result of a nationwide investigation that Attorney General Bonta announced on November 18, 2021.\n“Our bipartisan investigation has arrived at a solemn conclusion: Meta has been harming our children and teens, cultivating addiction to boost corporate profits,” said Attorney General Bonta. “With today’s lawsuit, we are drawing the line. We must protect our children and we will not back down from this fight. I am grateful for the collaboration of my fellow state attorneys general in standing up for our children and holding Meta accountable.\"\nIn today’s lawsuit, Attorney General Bonta alleges that Meta violated federal and state laws, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), California's False Advertising Law (FAL), and California’s Unfair Competition Law (UCL). COPPA is a federal law that protects the online privacy of children under 13 years old. California's FAL prohibits false and misleading advertising. California's UCL prohibits unlawful, unfair, and fraudulent business practices.\nAccording to the federal complaint, Meta’s misconduct included the following:\nCreating a business model focused on maximizing young users’ time on its platforms.\nEmploying harmful and psychologically manipulative platform features while misleading the public about the safety of those features.\nPublishing reports purporting to show misleadingly low rates of user harms.\nIn spite of the overwhelming evidence linking its platforms to young user harms, refusing to address those harms while continuing to conceal and downplay its platforms’ adverse effects.\nWhile much of the complaint includes information conditionally under seal as part of the investigation by the attorneys general, publicly available sources — including evidence disclosed by former Meta employees — also detail Meta’s efforts to attract young users and make its platforms addictive to children and teens. For example, the Wall Street Journal published an internal Facebook document in 2021 that said the following about young users: “They are a valuable but untapped audience.”\nIn addition to the lawsuit filed today against Meta, Attorney General Bonta has an ongoing investigation into TikTok for harms to youth associated with the use of its platform. On March 5, 2023, Attorney General Bonta filed an amicus brief supporting efforts to compel TikTok to produce subpoenaed materials and evidence. The TikTok investigation remains ongoing.\nStates joining today’s federal lawsuit against Meta are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Florida is filing its own federal lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida. They are joined by the District of Columbia, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, and Vermont, which have filed related actions in state court.\nA copy of the federal lawsuit can be found here.",

Businesses can choose whether they’d like to subscribe for one subscription on a single app, or a bundled subscription across Instagram and Facebook, and in the future WhatsApp. With a monthly subscription, businesses will gain access to a toolkit for their subscribed Facebook page, Instagram professional account or WhatsApp phone number that includes:\nA verified badge confirming your business is validated and authentic¹\nProactive impersonation monitoring for added brand protection\nAccess to support and help troubleshooting account issues²\nNew ways to be discovered:\nOn Instagram and Facebook, subscribers will be featured as a Meta Verified business, including appearing at or near the top of search results and as a recommended verified business to follow in feed.³\nWhatsApp business subscribers will receive additional premium features including the ability to create a custom WhatsApp page that is easily discoverable via a web search, and multi-device with chat assignment support so multiple employees can respond to customers.\nA Meta Verified business subscription complements the existing free and paid tools available to businesses on our apps today. We’re starting with subscription features that help small businesses achieve what they want most on the platform: to establish their brand and be discovered by new customers. As we learn from initial testing, we’ll continue to evolve our business offerings to add more value for businesses of all sizes, such as more tools for people to easily discover and engage with verified businesses on our apps.\nMeta Verified business subscriptions will be available for purchase on Instagram and Facebook in the coming weeks in select test countries. Monthly subscriptions start at $21.99 USD/month per Facebook page or Instagram account, or $34.99 USD/month for both.4 On WhatsApp, we’ll begin testing in the future with small businesses using the WhatsApp Business app before introducing Meta Verified to businesses on the WhatsApp Business Platform.5\nBuilding safeguards from the start\nJust as we did with our creator offering, Meta Verified for businesses is built with safeguards in mind from the start. We want businesses to feel confident their brands are protected on our apps, and people to feel confident the verified businesses they interact and message with are legitimate. As such, we’ve built a multi-step verification process and various checks into Meta Verified before, during, and after a business subscribes. For Instagram and Facebook subscriptions:\nBusinesses must meet eligibility requirements, including minimum tenure of Business Account and selected Facebook page / Instagram account, minimum page/account activity, and have 2Fac turned on.\nBusiness information must be validated and applicants must verify their connection to the business with methods such as phone number, email or domain verification.6\nSubscriptions include proactive monitoring for business impersonation.\n1. When you subscribe to Meta Verified on Instagram, the verified badge will also appear on Threads, if applicable. When you subscribe to Meta Verified on Facebook, the badge will also appear on Messenger, if applicable.\n2. Subscribers who advertise with Meta already receive the Meta Verified Instagram and Facebook account support benefit.\n3. All Meta Verified subscribers and their content must meet our Terms of Use and Community Guidelines. All content will be treated according to our existing guidelines for recommendations on Instagram or Facebook and our Content Guidelines. Subscribers will appear at or near the top of search results when a user query exactly matches a verified business name.\n4. Subscriptions purchased on mobile are $27.99 a month per Facebook page or Instagram professional account. At this time, businesses purchasing on mobile are limited to 1 business asset subscription (Facebook page or Instagram pro account).\n5. WhatsApp subscription pricing is not yet determined.\n6. Once verified, businesses may not change business details such as name or profile picture. In the future, Meta Verified businesses that wish to change their business details will need to undergo verification review again.",

    "content": "At Meta, we’ve spent over a decade working to keep people safe online. In that time, we’ve developed numerous tools and features to help prevent and combat potential harm – and as predators have adapted to try and evade our protections, we’ve continued to adapt too.\nWe’re excited about the opportunities that generative AI technology can bring, but we also want to make sure that innovation and safety go hand in hand. That’s why we take steps to build our generative AI features and models responsibly. For example, we conduct extensive red teaming exercises in areas like child exploitation with experts and address vulnerabilities we find.\nNow Meta is joining Thorn, All Tech is Human and other leading tech companies in an effort to prevent the misuse of gen AI tools to perpetrate child exploitation. Alongside our industry partners, Meta commits to the below Safety by Design principles from Thorn and All Tech is Human, to be applied as appropriate, and will provide updates on our progress. These principles will inform how we develop gen AI technology at Meta to help ensure we mitigate potential risks from the start.\nDEVELOP: Develop, build and train generative AI models that  proactively address child safety risks.\nResponsibly source our training datasets, and safeguard them from child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and child sexual exploitation material (CSEM):    This is essential to helping prevent generative models from producing AI-generated (AIG) CSAM and CSEM. The presence of CSAM and CSEM in training datasets for generative models is one avenue in which these models are able to reproduce this type of abusive content. For some models, their compositional generalization capabilities further allow them to combine concepts (e.g. adult sexual content and non-sexual depictions of children) to then produce AIG-CSAM. We are committed to avoiding or mitigating training data with a known risk of containing CSAM and CSEM. We are committed to detecting and removing CSAM and CSEM from our training data, and reporting any confirmed CSAM to the relevant authorities. We are committed to addressing the risk of creating AIG-CSAM that is posed by having depictions of children alongside adult sexual content in our video, image and audio generation training datasets.\nIncorporate feedback loops and iterative stress-testing strategies in our development process: Continuous learning and testing to understand a model’s capabilities to produce abusive content is key in effectively combating the adversarial misuse of these models downstream. If we don’t stress test our models for these capabilities, bad actors will do so regardless. We are committed to conducting structured, scalable and consistent stress testing of our models throughout the development process for their capability to produce AIG-CSAM and CSEM within the bounds of law, and integrating these findings back into model training and development to improve safety assurance for our generative AI products and systems.\nEmploy content provenance with adversarial misuse in mind: Bad actors use generative AI to create AIG-CSAM. This content is photorealistic, and can be produced at scale. Victim identification is already a needle in the haystack problem for law enforcement: sifting through huge amounts of content to find the child in active harm’s way. The expanding prevalence of AIG-CSAM is growing that haystack even further. Content provenance solutions that can be used to reliably discern whether content is AI-generated will be crucial to effectively respond to AIG-CSAM. We are committed to developing state of the art media provenance or detection solutions for our tools that generate images and videos. We are committed to deploying solutions to address adversarial misuse, such as considering incorporating watermarking or other techniques that embed signals imperceptibly in the content as part of the image and video generation process, as technically feasible.\nDEPLOY: Release and distribute generative AI models after they have been trained and evaluated for child safety, providing protections throughout the process.\nSafeguard our generative AI products and services from abusive content and conduct:  Our generative AI products and services empower our users to create and explore new horizons. These same users deserve to have that space of creation be free from fraud and abuse. We are committed to combating and responding to abusive content (CSAM, AIG-CSAM and CSEM) throughout our generative AI systems, and incorporating prevention efforts. Our users’ voices are key, and we are committed to incorporating user reporting or feedback options to empower these users to build freely on our platforms.\nResponsibly host models: As our models continue to achieve new capabilities and creative heights, a wide variety of deployment mechanisms manifests both opportunity and risk. Safety by design must encompass not just how our model is trained, but how our model is hosted. We are committed to responsible hosting of our first-party generative models, assessing them e.g. via red teaming or phased deployment for their potential to generate AIG-CSAM and CSEM, and implementing mitigations before hosting. We are also committed to responsibly hosting third party models in a way that minimizes the hosting of models that generate AIG-CSAM. We will ensure we have clear rules and policies around the prohibition of models that generate child safety violative content.\nEncourage developer ownership in safety by design: Developer creativity is the lifeblood of progress. This progress must come paired with a culture of ownership and responsibility. We encourage developer ownership in safety by design. We will endeavor to provide information about our models, including a child safety section detailing steps taken to avoid the downstream misuse of the model to further sexual harms against children. We are committed to supporting the developer ecosystem in their efforts to address child safety risks.\nMAINTAIN: Maintain model and platform safety by continuing to actively understand and respond to child safety risks.\nPrevent our services from scaling access to harmful tools: Bad actors have built models specifically to produce AIG-CSAM, in some cases targeting specific children to produce AIG-CSAM depicting their likeness. They also have built services that are used to “nudify” content of children, creating new AIG-CSAM. This is a severe violation of children’s rights. We are committed to removing from our platforms and search results these models and services. [This principle only applies to search engines and public-facing third party model providers.]\nInvest in research and future technology solutions: Combating child sexual abuse online is an ever-evolving threat, as bad actors adopt new technologies in their efforts. Effectively combating the misuse of generative AI to further child sexual abuse will require continued research to stay up to date with new harm vectors and threats. For example, new technology to protect user content from AI manipulation will be important to protecting children from online sexual abuse and exploitation. We are committed to investing in relevant research and technology development to address the use of generative AI for online child sexual abuse and exploitation. We will continuously seek to understand how our platforms, products and models are potentially being abused by bad actors. We are committed to maintaining the quality of our mitigations to meet and overcome the new avenues of misuse that may materialize.\nFight CSAM, AIG-CSAM and CSEM on our platforms: We are committed to fighting CSAM online and preventing our platforms from being used to create, store, solicit or distribute this material. As new threat vectors emerge, we are committed to meeting this moment. We are committed to detecting and removing child safety violative content on our platforms. We are committed to disallowing and combating CSAM, AIG-CSAM and CSEM on our platforms, and combating fraudulent uses of generative AI to sexually harm children.",

    "content": "Today, we’re taking a major step toward our vision for a more open computing platform for the metaverse. We’re opening up the operating system that powers our Meta Quest devices to third-party hardware makers, giving developers a larger ecosystem to build for and ultimately creating more choice for consumers. This platform is the product of a decade of investment into the underlying technologies that enable mixed reality, and opening it up means a lot more people will benefit from that investment. We’re working with leading global technology companies to create a new ecosystem of mixed reality devices, and we’re making it even easier for developers to build mixed reality apps.\nWe believe a more open ecosystem is the best way to bring the power of mixed reality to as many people as possible. With more devices, this new ecosystem will offer more choice to consumers and businesses around the world. Developers will have a much larger range of hardware that can run their apps, and more device makers will expand their market to a wider range of users, much like we’ve seen with PCs and smartphones.\nThis new hardware ecosystem will run on Meta Horizon OS, the mixed reality operating system that powers our Meta Quest headsets. Meta Horizon OS combines the core technologies that power today’s mixed reality experiences with a suite of features that put social presence at the center of the platform.\nMeta Horizon OS is the result of a decade of work at Meta to build a next-generation computing platform. To pioneer standalone headsets, we developed technologies like inside-out-tracking and self-tracked controllers. To allow for more natural interaction systems and social presence, we pioneered hand, eye, face and body tracking. And for mixed reality, we built a full stack of technologies for blending the digital and physical worlds, including high-resolution Passthrough, Scene Understanding and Spatial Anchors. This long-term investment that began on the mobile-first foundations of the Android Open Source Project has produced a full mixed reality operating system used by millions of people.\nDevelopers and creators can take advantage of all these technologies to create mixed reality experiences. And they can reach their audiences and grow their businesses through the content discovery and monetization platforms built into Meta Horizon OS, including the Meta Quest Store, which we’ll rename the Meta Horizon Store.\nThe social layer of Meta Horizon OS means people’s identities, avatars, social graphs and friend groups can move with them across virtual spaces, and developers can integrate these social features into their apps. And because this social layer is made to bridge multiple platforms, people can spend time together in virtual spaces that exist across mixed reality, mobile and desktop devices. Meta Horizon OS devices will also use the same mobile companion app that Meta Quest owners use today, which we’ll rename to the Meta Horizon app.\nA New Generation Of Hardware\nLeading global technology companies are already working to bring this new ecosystem to life with new devices built on Meta Horizon OS:\nASUS’s Republic of Gamers will use its expertise as a leader in gaming solutions to develop an all-new performance gaming headset.\nLenovo will draw on its experience co-designing Oculus Rift S, as well as deep expertise in engineering leading devices like the ThinkPad laptop series, to develop mixed reality devices for productivity, learning, and entertainment.\nXbox and Meta teamed up last year to bring Xbox Cloud Gaming (Beta) to Meta Quest, letting people play Xbox games on a large 2D virtual screen in mixed reality. Now, we’re working together again to create a limited-edition Meta Quest, inspired by Xbox.\nAll of these devices will benefit from Meta’s long-term partnership with Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., which builds the Snapdragon® processors that are tightly integrated with our software and hardware stacks.\nA More Open App Ecosystem\nAs we begin opening Meta Horizon OS to more device makers, we’re also expanding the ways app developers can reach their audiences. We’re beginning the process of removing the barriers between the Meta Horizon Store and App Lab, which lets any developer who meets basic technical and content requirements release software on the platform. App Lab titles will soon be featured in a dedicated section of the store on all our devices, making them easy for larger audiences to discover.\nWe’re also developing a new spatial app framework that helps mobile developers create mixed reality experiences. Developers will be able to use the tools they’re already familiar with to bring their mobile apps to Meta Horizon OS or to create entirely new mixed reality apps.\nConsumers and developers alike will benefit from an ecosystem where multiple hardware makers build on a common platform. We look forward to continuing on this journey to bring mixed reality to more people.",

    "content": "Today, we’re launching new generative AI features, and like other Meta products, we took steps to protect your privacy and offer greater transparency as we built these exciting new features. We developed privacy mitigations through our privacy review process and external engagements, and below are some helpful details on how we’ve trained our models, how interacting with our conversational AIs is different from interacting with friends or family, and where you can find more information about your privacy and our new generative AI features.\nHow do we train our generative AI models in a way that respects people’s privacy?\nEarlier this year, we released our large language model, Llama 2, for academic and commercial purposes, and we shared specific details on how we trained the foundational models, which didn’t include Meta user data. The consumer generative AI features we launched today leverage the work we did to build our large language model, and we included additional privacy safeguards and integrity mitigations as we built new models and used information from our products and services.\nGenerative AI models take a large amount of data to effectively train, so a combination of sources are used for training, including information that’s publicly available online, licensed data and information from Meta’s products and services. For publicly available online information, we filtered the dataset to exclude certain websites that commonly share personal information. Publicly shared posts from Instagram and Facebook – including photos and text – were part of the data used to train the generative AI models underlying the features we announced at Connect. We didn’t train these models using people’s private posts. We also do not use the content of your private messages with friends and family to train our AIs. We may use the data from your use of AI stickers, such as your searches for a sticker to use in a chat, to improve our AI sticker models.\nWe use the information people share when interacting with our generative AI features, such as Meta AI or businesses who use generative AI, to improve our products and for other purposes. You can read more about the data we collect and how we use your information in our new Privacy Guide, the Meta AI Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy.\nWhat happens with the information I send the generative AI features?\nThe AIs may retain and use information you share in a chat to provide more personalized responses or relevant information in that conversation, and we may share certain questions you ask with trusted partners, such as search providers, to give you more relevant, accurate, and up-to-date responses.\nIt’s important to know that we train and tune our generative AI models to limit the possibility of private information that you may share with generative AI features from appearing in responses to other people. We use automated technology and people to review interactions with our AI so we can, among other things, reduce the likelihood that models’ outputs would include someone’s personal information as well as improve model performance.\nTo give you more control, we’ve built in commands that allow you to delete information shared in any chat with an AI across Messenger, Instagram, or WhatsApp. For example you can delete your AI messages by typing “/reset-ai” in a conversation. Using a generative AI feature provided by Meta does not link your WhatsApp account information to your account information on Facebook, Instagram, or any other apps provided by Meta.\nAs Meta AI works today, it cannot be brought into the chat by Meta in WhatsApp, Instagram or Messenger, and can’t message you or your group first. In group chats with friends and family where someone asks Meta AI to join, this conversational AI only reads messages that invoke “@Meta AI” or messages where a reply invokes “@Meta AI.” Meta AI does not access other messages in the chat.\nWhere can I find more information about Meta’s generative AI features?\nWe also provide some in-product transparency tools that help people understand when someone is interacting with or seeing content created by our generative AI features. For example, photorealistic images created by Meta’s generative AI features include visual watermarks to make it clear that the image has been created with AI. We’ve published Help Center articles to help you understand how to interact with our generative AI features.\nOur Newsroom post on building generative AI responsibly provides more detail on other safety measures for the generative AI features we’re launching at Connect. We also developed two Generative AI System Cards that can be found on Meta’s AI website and a transparency resource that provides more details on our generative AI model and features.\nWe have a responsibility to protect your privacy and have teams dedicated to this work for everything we build. Alongside industry peers, we’re participating in the Partnership on AI’s Synthetic Media Framework and we have signed onto the White House’s voluntary commitments for AI. These collaborations and our ongoing work with experts, policymakers, advocates and more help us improve the experiences of people interacting with our generative AI features. We’ll continue to build on these efforts and integrate additional privacy safeguards as we improve our generative AI technologies.",

    "content": "Meta believes that an open approach to technology can lead to more innovation, more accountability and better outcomes for everyone. That’s why we have pioneered innovative governance solutions, beginning in 2020 with the Oversight Board, which provides independent accountability of our content decisions, and expanding in 2022 to Community Forums including our recent Community Forum on Generative AI.\nThese Community Forums bring together representative groups of people from all over the world to discuss and debate with each other and experts in the field, and then share their perspectives. We started off with a pilot on climate misinformation before running our first full Community Forum on bullying and harassment in the metaverse. This involved over 6,000 participants across 32 countries – what we think was the single largest deliberative exercise ever. In the last year, other platforms have been exploring deliberative mechanisms for AI governance, which is a positive development toward standardizing a more open approach in the industry.\nToday, Stanford’s Deliberative Democracy Lab, the Behavioral Insights Team (BIT) and Meta are releasing the findings from the recent Community Forum on Generative AI that included over 1,500 people in Brazil, Germany, Spain and the United States. The Forum was designed to solicit public feedback to complement the input we receive from experts, academics and other stakeholders through our policy development processes. It covered two overarching questions around the types of principles that should be reflected in generative AI chatbots, including how they should interact with people and provide guidance and advice. We’re publicly sharing the results of these forums so more companies, researchers and governments can benefit from what participants shared.\nKey Findings from the Community Forum\nThe Forum found that people are open to generative AI chatbots, but want to ensure developers are building with transparency and control features in mind. The full report shares more details about participants’ views on each proposal – here are some of the key takeaways:\nA majority of participants from each country thought AI has had a positive impact, and this view increased through deliberations.\nA majority believe AI chatbots should be able to use past conversations to improve responses, as long as people are informed. Agreement with this proposal rose as a result of the deliberations.\nAfter deliberating, a majority of participants believed that AI chatbots can be human-like as long as people are informed.\nParticipants’ perspectives changed as a result of the deliberation, by as much as 20.5% on some questions, and often toward consensus on some of the Forum’s most pressing topics. This shows the process of deliberating with one another and engaging with experts helped participants to better understand the proposals and tradeoffs.\nWe design Community Forums to be principles-based with the ability to inform our long-term approaches, particularly given the fluid and fast-moving nature of technology. Our teams have been reviewing these findings as they can help plan for future work.\nLooking ahead, we will run a similar Community Forum on generative AI in other regions of the world to continue to get additional feedback from people on the principles that should guide approaches to AI from companies like ours, governments and society. We’re also considering additional methods to democratize inputs into our product development. We plan to share the results of these in the Transparency Center.",

    "content": "Update on February 6, 2024 at 5:00AM PT:\nOriginally published on November 28, 2023 at 4:00PM PT:\nNext year, more than two billion people will head to the polls in elections across some of the world’s biggest democracies, including the United States, India, Indonesia, Mexico and the European Union. Over many years, Meta has developed a comprehensive approach for elections on our platforms. With so many important elections approaching, we are setting out how the policies and safeguards we have established over time will apply in 2024.\nNo tech company does more or invests more to protect elections online than Meta – not just during election periods but at all times. We have around 40,000 people working on safety and security, with more than $20 billion invested in teams and technology in this area since 2016. While much of our approach has remained consistent for some time, we’re continually adapting to ensure we are on top of new challenges, including the use of AI. We’ve also built the largest independent fact-checking network of any platform, with nearly 100 partners around the world to review and rate viral misinformation in more than 60 languages.\nThis approach is consistent with how we have sought to prevent abuse of our platforms during recent major elections in Nigeria, Thailand, Turkey and Argentina, and this year’s state and local elections in the US. While we are conscious that every election brings its own challenges and complexities, we’re confident our comprehensive approach puts us in a strong position to protect the integrity of next year’s elections on our platforms.\nIndustry-Leading Transparency Around Political Ads\nSince 2018, we have provided industry-leading transparency for ads about social issues, elections or politics. Advertisers who run these ads are required to complete an authorization process and include a “paid for by” disclaimer. These ads are then stored in our publicly available Ad Library for seven years. For example, there are now more than 15 million US entries in our Ad Library.\nStarting in the new year, advertisers will also have to disclose when they use AI or other digital techniques to create or alter a political or social issue ad in certain cases. This applies if the ad contains a photorealistic image or video, or realistic sounding audio, that was digitally created or altered to depict a real person as saying or doing something they did not say or do. It also applies if an ad depicts a realistic-looking person that does not exist or a realistic-looking event that did not happen, alters footage of a real event, or depicts a realistic event that allegedly occurred, but that is not a true image, video, or audio recording of the event.\nAs in previous years, we will also block new political, electoral and social issue ads during the final week of the US election campaign. Ads that have previously run before this restriction period will be allowed to run during this time. Our rationale for this restriction period remains the same as it has since 2020: in the final days of an election, we recognize there may not be enough time to contest new claims made in ads. This restriction period will lift the day after the election. You can find more details of our approach to the 2024 US Presidential election in this fact sheet.\nPreventing Election and Voter Interference\nWe continually review and update our election-related policies, and take action if content violates our Community Standards, including our policies on election and voter interference, hate speech, coordinating harm and publicizing crime, and bullying and harassment. We remove this content whether it was created by a person or AI.\nOur teams fight both foreign interference and domestic influence operations, and have taken down more than 200 malicious influence campaigns involved in what we call Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior. We’ve also designated more than 700 hate groups around the world – including more than 400 white supremacist organizations – and we continue to identify and assess new hate groups, particularly when they are tied to real-world violence. We’re also investing in proactive threat detection and have expanded our policies to help address harassment against election officials and poll workers.\nWe label state-controlled media on Facebook, Instagram and Threads so that users know when content is from a publication that may be wholly or partially under the editorial control of a government. As we have since 2020, we also block ads from state-controlled media outlets targeting people in the US.",

    "content": "My daughter was 12 years old when we gave her her first phone. It wasn’t an easy decision, and I agonized over whether it was the right time. As a former teacher, advisor to a state attorney general, and now an executive at Meta — I’ve dedicated my career to protecting children online. You’d think I would be confident of the right rules and guardrails to put in place for my daughter, but I worried all the same.\nBeing a parent is hard. Parents have always had the constant worry of how their children are doing in school, on the playground, on the sports field, but today’s generation of parents have a whole new world to navigate with their children: their online lives. I think about these challenges every day as we work to develop safe, positive experiences for young people on apps like Instagram, and as we think about making things simpler for parents.\nParents want to be involved in their teen’s online lives, and recent Pew research suggests that 81% of US adults support requiring parental consent for teens to create a social media account. But technology is constantly changing and keeping up with all the apps teens use can feel impossible. As an industry, we should come together with lawmakers to create simple, efficient ways for parents to oversee their teens’ online experiences.\nTechnology companies are developing distinct, age-appropriate experiences for teens, while lawmakers consider new legislation designed to protect their safety and privacy online. Legislation is needed so all apps teens use can be held to the same standard. But what’s happening is much more complicated than that.\nUS states are passing a patchwork of different laws, many of which require teens (of varying ages) to get their parent’s approval to use certain apps, and for everyone to verify their age to access them. Teens move interchangeably between many websites and apps, and social media laws that hold different platforms to different standards in different states will mean teens are inconsistently protected.\nThere’s a better way. Parents should approve their teen’s app downloads, and we support federal legislation that requires app stores to get parents’ approval whenever their teens under 16 download apps. With this solution, when a teen wants to download an app, app stores would be required to notify their parents, much like when parents are notified if their teen attempts to make a purchase. Parents can decide if they want to approve the download. They can also verify the age of their teen when setting up their phone, negating the need for everyone to verify their age multiple times across multiple apps.\nThis way parents can oversee and approve their teen’s online activity in one place. They can ensure their teens are not accessing adult content or apps, or apps they just don’t want their teens to use. And where apps like ours offer age-appropriate features and settings, parents can help ensure their teens use them.\nThis solution also helps to preserve privacy. By verifying a teen’s age on the app store, individual apps would not be required to collect potentially sensitive identifying information. Apps would only need the age from the app store to ensure teens are placed in the right experiences for their age group. Parents and teens won’t need to provide the hundreds of apps their teens use with sensitive information like government IDs.\nThe best way to help support parents and young people is a simple, industry-wide solution where all apps are held to the same, consistent standard. We are working with our industry peers and lawmakers directly to advocate for this concept, and to ease the burden on parents.",

    "content": ",  /PRNewswire/ -- Meta Platforms, Inc. (Nasdaq: META) today reported financial results for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.\n\"We had a good quarter as our community and business continue to grow,\" said Mark Zuckerberg, Meta founder and CEO. \"We've made a lot of progress on our vision for advancing AI and the metaverse.\"\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Highlights\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\nIn millions, except percentages and per share amounts\nDiluted earnings per share (EPS)\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Operational and Other Financial Highlights\nFamily daily active people (DAP) – DAP was 3.19 billion on average for December 2023, an increase of 8% year-over-year.\nFamily monthly active people (MAP) – MAP was 3.98 billion as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 6% year-over-year.\nFacebook daily active users (DAUs) – DAUs were 2.11 billion on average for December 2023, an increase of 6% year-over-year.\nFacebook monthly active users (MAUs) – MAUs were 3.07 billion as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 3% year-over-year.\nAd impressions and price per ad – In the fourth quarter of 2023, ad impressions delivered across our Family of Apps increased by 21% year-over-year and the average price per ad increased by 2% year-over-year. For the full year 2023, ad impressions increased by 28% year-over-year and the average price per ad decreased by 9% year-over-year.\nRevenue – Revenue was $40.11 billion and $134.90 billion, an increase of 25% and 16% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and full year 2023, respectively. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with the same periods of 2022, revenue would have been $816 million and $374 million lower, an increase of 22% and 15% on a constant currency basis for the fourth quarter and full year 2023, respectively.\nCosts and expenses – Total costs and expenses were $23.73 billion and $88.15 billion for the fourth quarter and full year 2023, a decrease of 8% and an increase of 1% year-over-year, respectively. Restructuring charges included in costs and expenses were $1.15 billion and $3.45 billion for the fourth quarter and full year 2023, respectively.\nCapital expenditures – Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $7.90 billion and $28.10 billion for the fourth quarter and full year 2023, respectively.\nShare repurchases – We repurchased $6.32 billion and $20.03 billion of our Class A common stock in the fourth quarter and full year 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, we had $30.93 billion available and authorized for repurchases. We also announced a $50 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization today.\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities – Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $65.40 billion as of December 31, 2023. Free cash flow was $11.50 billion and $43.01 billion for the fourth quarter and full year 2023, respectively.\nLong-term debt – Long-term debt was $18.39 billion as of December 31, 2023.\nHeadcount – Headcount was 67,317 as of December 31, 2023, a decrease of 22% year-over-year.\nToday, Meta's board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.50 per share of our outstanding common stock (including both Class A common stock and Class B common stock), payable on March 26, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 22, 2024. We intend to pay a cash dividend on a quarterly basis going forward, subject to market conditions and approval by our board of directors.\nBeginning in 2022, we initiated several measures to pursue greater efficiency and to realign our business and strategic priorities. As of December 31, 2023, we have completed the data center initiatives and the employee layoffs, and substantially completed the facilities consolidation initiatives.\nA summary of our restructuring charges, including subsequent adjustments, for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023 by major activity type is as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2023\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2023\nSeverance and Other Personnel Costs\n$                 86\n$              —\n$                7\n$              93\n$               177\n$               —\n$          (224)\n$             (47)\n$            1,100\n$              41\n$                7\n$         1,148\n$            2,506\n$          1,170\n$          (224)\n$         3,452\nDuring the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded total restructuring charges of $4.20 billion and $4.61 billion, respectively.\nWe expect first quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $34.5-37 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $94-99 billion, unchanged from our prior outlook. We continue to expect a few factors to be drivers of total expense growth in 2024:\nFirst, we expect higher infrastructure-related costs this year. Given our increased capital investments in recent years, we expect depreciation expenses in 2024 to increase by a larger amount than in 2023. We also expect to incur higher operating costs from running a larger infrastructure footprint.\nSecond, we anticipate growth in payroll expenses as we work down our current hiring underrun and add incremental talent to support priority areas in 2024, which we expect will further shift our workforce composition toward higher-cost technical roles.\nFinally, for Reality Labs, we expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts in augmented reality/virtual reality and our investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $30-37 billion, a $2 billion increase of the high end of our prior range. We expect growth will be driven by investments in servers, including both AI and non-AI hardware, and data centers as we ramp up construction on sites with our previously announced new data center architecture. Our updated outlook reflects our evolving understanding of our artificial intelligence (AI) capacity demands as we anticipate what we may need for the next generations of foundational research and product development. While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect our ambitious long-term AI research and product development efforts will require growing infrastructure investments beyond this year.\nAbsent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our full-year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor the active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results. Of note, the Federal Trade Commission is seeking to substantially modify our existing consent order and impose additional restrictions on our ability to operate. We are contesting this matter, but if we are unsuccessful it would have an adverse impact on our business.\nThis was a pivotal year for our company. We increased our operating discipline, delivered strong execution across our product priorities, and improved advertising performance for the businesses who rely on our services. We will look to build on our progress in each of those areas in 2024 while advancing our ambitious, longer-term efforts in AI and Reality Labs.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 1:30 p.m. PT / 4:30 p.m. ET today. The live webcast of Meta's earnings conference call can be accessed at investor.fb.com, along with the earnings press release, financial tables, and slide presentation. Meta uses the investor.fb.com and about.fb.com/news/ websites as well as Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook Page (facebook.com/zuck), Instagram account (instagram.com/zuck) and Threads profile (threads.net/zuck) as means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\nFollowing the call, a replay will be available at the same website. A telephonic replay will be available for one week following the conference call at +1 (800) 770-2030 or +1 (647) 362-9199, conference ID 8032328.\nTranscripts of conference calls with publishing equity research analysts held today will also be posted to the investor.fb.com website.\nMeta builds technologies that help people connect, find communities, and grow businesses. When Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world. Now, Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build the next evolution in social technology.\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements regarding our future business plans and expectations. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on October 26, 2023, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is February 1, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nWe exclude the following items from our non-GAAP financial measures:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2023 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.

    "content": "Today during Connect, we introduced new AI experiences across our family of apps and devices, including testing 28 AIs with unique interests and personalities for you to interact with and dive deeper into your interests. While we’re rolling out the ability for you to interact directly with these AIs via our messaging platforms, we’re also launching their social profiles on Facebook and Instagram today so you can follow them and get to know what they’re all about.\nMany of these profile pictures look familiar because we partnered with well known public figures to embody some of these AIs – but these familiar faces are representing the characters, not themselves. The public-facing social profiles and related visual content creation is managed by Meta. When we generate images for social posts using AI, you’ll see #ImaginedWithAI on the post along with a watermark on the lower left hand corner of the image.\nIf you are part of the beta product rollout in the U.S., you’ll be able to interact with the AIs directly from their social profiles by sending them a message on Instagram or Messenger. The AIs’ responses to your direct messages are generated by Meta’s AI technology.\nBelow is the list of AI social profiles you can follow on Facebook and Instagram:\nAlvin the Alien – greetingsalvin – Facebook Instagram\nAmber – amberthedetective – Facebook Instagram\nAngie – trainwithangie – Facebook Instagram\nBecca – dogloverbecca – Facebook Instagram\nBillie – yoursisbillie – Facebook Instagram\nBob the Robot – robotakabob – Facebook Instagram\nBrian – hellograndpabrian – Facebook Instagram\nBru – gameonbru – Facebook Instagram\nCarter- datingwithcarter – Facebook Instagram\nCoco – cocosgotmoves – Facebook Instagram\nDungeon Master – meethedungeonmaster – Facebook Instagram\nDylan – craftwithdylan – Facebook Instagram\nIzzy – izzythedreamer – Facebook Instagram\nJade – jadeonthebeats – Facebook Instagram\nJane Austen – janeaustenpen – Facebook Instagram\nLeo – levelupwithleo – Facebook Instagram\nLily – lilysliterarycorner – Facebook Instagram\nLiv – himamaliv – Facebook Instagram\nLorena – globetrottinglorena – Facebook Instagram\nLuiz – dontmesswithluiz – Facebook Instagram\nMax – cookwithmax – Facebook Instagram\nPerry – golfwithperry – Facebook Instagram\nSally – goodtimesal – Facebook Instagram\nScarlett – chatwithScarlett – Facebook Instagram\nTamika – sailortamika – Facebook Instagram\nThalia – playwiththalia – Facebook Instagram\nVictor – zerotovictor – Facebook Instagram\nZach – comedyzach – Facebook Instagram",

As a result, we find and report more child sexual abuse material to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) than any other service today.\nMany in our industry recognize the need to work together to protect children and stop predators. We use technology like Microsoft’s PhotoDNA and Meta’s PDQ to stop the spread of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on the internet, but we need additional solutions to stop predators from using different apps and websites to target children.\nPredators don’t limit their attempts to harm children to individual platforms. They use multiple apps and websites and adapt their tactics across them all to avoid detection. When a predator is discovered and removed from a site for breaking its rules, they may head to one of the many other apps or websites they use to target children.\nThis is behavior experts in online child safety understand well, and something we knew we could do more to address with our peers, so we worked with our partners at the Tech Coalition to establish Lantern. As described in the Tech Coalition’s announcement today, Lantern enables technology companies to share a variety of signals about accounts and behaviors that violate their child safety policies. Lantern participants can use this information to conduct investigations on their own platforms and take action.\nMeta was a founding member of Lantern. We provided the Tech Coalition with the technical infrastructure that sits behind the program and encouraged our industry partners to use it. We manage and oversee the technology with the Tech Coalition, ensuring it is simple to use and provides our partners with the information they need to track down potential predators on their own platforms.\nOne example of Lantern’s value is an investigation Meta conducted following information provided by Lantern partner MEGA during the program’s pilot phase. MEGA shared URLs with Lantern that they had previously removed for violating their child safety policies. Meta’s specialist child safety team used this information to conduct a wider investigation into potentially violating behaviors related to these URLs on our platforms. The team removed over 10,000 violating Facebook Profiles, Pages and Instagram accounts in the course of the investigation. In accordance with our legal obligations, we reported the violating profiles, pages and accounts to NCMEC. In addition, we shared details of our investigation back to Lantern, enabling participating companies to use the signals to conduct their own investigations.\nWe’re glad to partner with the Tech Coalition and our peers on the Lantern program, and we hope others in the industry will join us to expand this important work.",

    "content": "In early April 2024, we will deprecate Facebook News – a dedicated tab in the bookmarks section on Facebook that spotlights news – in the US and Australia. This follows our September 2023 announcement that we deprecated Facebook News in the UK, France and Germany last year.\nThis is part of an ongoing effort to better align our investments to our products and services people value the most. As a company, we have to focus our time and resources on things people tell us they want to see more of on the platform, including short form video. The number of people using Facebook News in Australia and the U.S. has dropped by over 80% last year. We know that people don’t come to Facebook for news and political content — they come to connect with people and discover new opportunities, passions and interests. As we previously shared in 2023, news makes up less than 3% of what people around the world see in their Facebook feed, and is a small part of the Facebook experience for the vast majority of people.\nThe changes affecting the Facebook News feature will not otherwise impact Meta’s products and services in these countries. People will still be able to view links to news articles on Facebook. News publishers will continue to have access to their Facebook accounts and Pages, where they can post links to their stories and direct people to their websites, in the same way any other individual or organization can. News organizations can also still leverage products like Reels and our ads system to reach broader audiences and drive people to their website, where they keep 100% of the revenue derived from outbound links on Facebook.\nWhile we’ll be deprecating Facebook News in these countries, this announcement does not impact the terms under our existing Facebook News agreements with publishers in Australia, France and Germany. These deals have already expired in the US and the UK. Additionally, to ensure that we continue to invest in products and services that drive user engagement, we will not enter into new commercial deals for traditional news content in these countries and will not offer new Facebook products specifically for news publishers in the future.\nOur Commitment to Connecting People to Reliable Information\nThis does not impact our commitment to connecting people to reliable information on our platforms. We work with third-party fact-checkers — certified through accreditation bodies like the non-partisan International Fact-Checking Network — who review and rate viral misinformation on our apps. We have built the largest global fact-checking network of any platform by partnering with more than 90 independent fact-checking organizations around the world who review content in more than 60 languages. We have contributed more than $150 million to programs supporting our fact-checking efforts since 2016 to combat the spread of misinformation and we will continue to invest in this area.",

    "content": "For more than a decade, Meta’s Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) team has focused on advancing the state of the art in AI through open research. As the field rapidly innovates, we believe that collaboration with the global AI community is more important than ever.\nToday, we’re excited to share some of the most recent FAIR research models with the global community. We’re publicly releasing five models including image-to-text and text-to-music generation models, a multi-token prediction model and a technique for detecting AI-generated speech. By publicly sharing this research, we hope to inspire iterations and ultimately help advance AI in a responsible way.\nMeta Chameleon Can Process and Generate Both Text and Images\nWe are publicly releasing key components of our Chameleon models under a research-only license. Chameleon is a family of mixed-modal models that can understand and generate both images and text. Just as humans can process the words and images simultaneously, Chameleon can process and deliver both image and text at the same time. While most large language models usually have unimodal results (where they turn texts into images, for example) Chameleon can take any combination of text and images as input and also output any combination of text and images. And the possibilities with Chameleon are endless: imagine generating creative captions for images or using a mix of text prompts and images to create an entirely new scene.\nMulti-Token Prediction Helps Train AI Models to Predict Words Faster\nTrained on large amounts of text, large language models (LLMs) are already helping people to generate creative text, brainstorm ideas and answer questions. LLMs have a simple training objective: predicting the next word. While this approach is simple and scalable, it’s also inefficient. It requires several orders of magnitude more text than what children need to learn the same degree of language fluency.\nIn April, we proposed a new approach to build better and faster LLMs by using multi-token prediction. Using this approach, we train language models to predict multiple future words at once – instead of the former one-at-a-time approach. In the spirit of responsible open science, we are releasing the pretrained models for code completion under a non-commercial, research-only license.\nJASCO Offers More Control Over AI Music Generation\nGenerative AI has enabled people to explore their creativity in new ways, such as by turning a text prompt into a clip of music. While existing text-to-music models like MusicGen rely mainly on text inputs for music generation, our new model, JASCO, is capable of accepting various inputs, such as chords or beat, to improve control over generated music outputs.\nThis allows the incorporation of both symbols and audio in the same text-to-music generation model.\nResults suggest that JASCO is comparable to the evaluated baselines considering generation quality, while allowing significantly better and more versatile controls over the generated music.\nAudioSeal Helps Detect AI-Generated Speech\nWe are also releasing AudioSeal, which we believe is the first audio watermarking technique designed specifically for the localized detection of AI-generated speech. AudioSeal makes it possible to pinpoint AI-generated segments within a longer audio snippet.\nUnlike traditional methods that rely on complex decoding algorithms, AudioSeal’s localized detection approach allows for faster and more efficient detection. This design enhances the detection speed by up to 485 times compared to previous methods, making it suitable for large-scale and real-time applications.\nAudioSeal is being released under a commercial license. It’s just one of several lines of responsible research we have shared to help prevent the misuse of generative AI tools.\nIncreasing Diversity in Text-To-Image Generation Systems\nIt’s important that text-to-image models work well for everyone and reflect the geographical and cultural diversity of the world. To achieve this, we developed automatic indicators to evaluate potential geographical disparities in text-to-image models.\nIn addition, to understand how people in different regions vary in their perceptions of geographic representation, we conducted a large-scale annotation study. We collected more than 65,000 annotations and more than twenty survey responses per example covering appeal, similarity, consistency and shared recommendations for improved automatic and human evaluations of text-to-image models. This enables more diversity and better representation in AI-generated images.\nToday, we’re releasing geographic disparities evaluation code and our annotations, which we hope will help the community improve diversity across their generative models.",

Indeed, Meta says that consuming video content now makes up 50% of the time spent across Facebook and Instagram, which could make this a valuable expansion of the existing Catalog Ad offering.\nMeta advises that brands should look to keep their video elements short:\n“It’s important to hook your audience within the first 2 seconds of the video and provide them with a call to action within 5 to 6 seconds.”\nWhile brands should also be aware of the “safe zones” for video content to avoid having their messages obscured by the UI.\nIt could be a handy option.

    "content": "Meta has been a pioneer in AI for more than a decade. We’ve released more than 1,000 AI models, libraries, and data sets for researchers – including the latest version of our large language model, Llama 2, available in partnership with Microsoft.\nAt Connect 2023, we announced several new generative AI features that people can use to make the experiences they have on our platforms even more social and immersive. Our hope is that generative AI tools like these can help people in a variety of ways. Imagine a group of friends planning a trip together: In a group chat, they can ask an AI assistant for activity and restaurant suggestions. In another case, a teacher could use an AI to help create lesson plans that are customized for different learning styles of individual students.\nBuilding this technology comes with the responsibility to develop best practices and policies. While there are many exciting and creative use cases for generative AI, it won’t always be perfect. The underlying models, for example, have the potential to generate fictional responses or exacerbate stereotypes it may learn from its training data. We’ve incorporated lessons we’ve learned over the last decade into our new features – like notices so people understand the limits of generative AI, and integrity classifiers that help us catch and remove dangerous responses. These are being done in line with industry best practices outlined in the Llama 2 Responsible Use Guide.\nIn keeping with our commitment to responsible AI, we also stress test our products to improve safety performance and regularly collaborate with policymakers, experts in academia and civil society, and others in our industry to advance the responsible use of this technology. We’ll be rolling these features out step by step, and launching the AIs in beta. We’ll continue to iterate on and improve these features as the technologies evolve and we see how people use them in their daily lives.\nHow are we building responsibly and prioritizing people’s safety?\nThe custom AI models that power new text-based experiences like Meta AI, our large language model-powered assistant, are built on the foundation of Llama 2 and leverage its safety and responsibility training. We’ve also been investing in specific measures for the features we announced today.\nWe’re sharing a resource that explains in more detail the steps we’re taking to identify potential vulnerabilities, reduce risks, enhance safety, and bolster reliability. For example:\nWe’re evaluating and improving our conversational AIs with external and internal experts through red teaming exercises. Dedicated teams of experts have spent thousands of hours stress-testing these models, looking for unexpected ways they might be used along with identifying and fixing vulnerabilities.\nWe’re fine-tuning the models. This includes training the models to perform specific tasks, such as generating high-quality images, with instructions that can increase the likelihood of providing helpful responses. We’re also training them to provide expert-backed resources in response to safety issues. For example, the AIs will suggest local suicide and eating disorder organizations in response to certain queries, while making it clear that it cannot provide medical advice.\nWe’re training our models on safety and responsibility guidelines. Teaching the models guidelines means they are less likely to share responses that are potentially harmful or inappropriate for all ages on our apps.\nWe’re taking steps to reduce bias. Addressing potential bias in generative AI systems is a new area of research. As with other AI models, having more people use the features and share feedback can help us refine our approach.\nWe’ve developed new technology to catch and take action on content that violates our policies. Our teams have built algorithms that scan and filter out harmful responses before they’re shared back to people.\nWe’ve built feedback tools within these features. No AI model is perfect. We’ll use the feedback we receive to keep training the models to improve safety performance and automatic detection of policy violations. We’re also making our new generative AI features available to security researchers through Meta’s long-running bug bounty program.\nHow are we protecting people’s privacy?\nWe’re held accountable for protecting people’s privacy by regulators, policymakers, and experts. We work with them to ensure that what we build follows best practices and meets high standards for data protection.\nWe believe it’s important that people understand the types of data we use to train the models that power our generative AI products. For example, we do not use your private messages with friends and family to train our AIs. We may use the data from your use of AI stickers, such as your searches for a sticker to use in a chat, to improve our AI sticker models. You can find out more about the types of data we use in our Privacy Matters post on generative AI.\nHow are we making sure people know how to use the new features and understand their limitations?\nWe provide information within the features to help people understand when they’re interacting with AI and how this new technology works. We denote in the product experience that they might return inaccurate or inappropriate outputs.\nThis past year, we published 22 ‘System Cards’ to give people understandable information about how our AI systems make decisions that affect them. Today, we’re sharing new generative AI System Cards on Meta’s AI website – one for AI systems that generate text that powers Meta AI and another for AI systems that generate images for AI stickers, Meta AI, restyle, and backdrop. These include an interactive demo so people can see how refining their prompt affects the output from the models.\nHow are we helping people to know when images are created with our AI features?\nWe’re following industry best practices so it’s harder for people to spread misinformation with our tools. Images created or edited by Meta AI, restyle, and backdrop will have visible markers so people know the content was created by AI. We’re also developing additional techniques to include information within image files that were created by Meta AI, and we intend to expand this to other experiences as the technology improves. We’re not planning to add these features to AI stickers, since they are not photorealistic and are therefore unlikely to mislead people into thinking they are real.\nCurrently, there aren’t any common standards for identifying and labeling AI-generated content across the industry. We think there should be, so we are working with other companies through forums like the Partnership on AI in the hope of developing them.\nWhat steps are we taking to stop people from spreading misinformation using generative AI?\nAI is a key part of how we tackle misinformation and other harmful content. For example, we developed AI technologies to match near-duplications of previously fact-checked content. We also have a tool called Few-Shot Learner that can adapt more easily to take action on new or evolving types of harmful content quickly, working across more than 100 languages. Previously, we would have needed to gather thousands or sometimes even millions of examples to build a data set large enough to train an AI model, and then do the fine tuning to make it work properly. Few-Shot Learner can train an AI model based on only a handful of examples.\nGenerative AI could help us take down harmful content faster and more accurately than existing AI tools. We’ve started testing large language models (LLMs) by training them on our Community Standards to help determine whether a piece of content violates our policies or not. These initial tests suggest the LLMs can perform better than existing machine learning models, or at least enhance ones like Few-Shot Learner, and we’re optimistic generative AI can help us enforce our policies in the future.",

    "content": "Sometimes separate is simpler, so we’re making it easier to customize your experience on Facebook with multiple personal profiles. Whether you’re new to Facebook or a longtime user, you may want to keep your personal and professional relationships separate, or you may want to keep one profile tied to a community you’re a part of and another profile just for friends. Creating multiple personal profiles lets you easily organize who you share with and what content you see for the various parts of your life. Think one profile for the foodie scene you love and another one to keep up with your friends and family.\nWe already offer controls that let you choose what audience you’re sharing with on Facebook, but after experimenting with multiple profiles over the last year, we heard from people that clearer organization of friends, groups, and interests helps them feel freer to engage with the audience they believe is most relevant. And we’ve seen the success of separate interest-based accounts on Instagram, so we’re excited to bring this option to Facebook. The ability to create multiple personal profiles is starting to roll out globally today and will continue over the next few months.\nChoose a name and have an @username for up to four additional personal profiles.\nConnect with the people or communities you choose so each profile has a unique Feed with relevant content and shared interests.\nEasily switch between your profiles, with no login required.\nAt launch, some Facebook features — such as Dating, Marketplace, Professional Mode and payments — will not be available to additional personal profiles. To start, messaging will be available within the Facebook app and on the web for additional personal profiles. We plan to expand Messenger support for additional profiles in the coming months. The option for an additional personal profile will be available only to eligible adult accounts.\nWhen you create an additional personal profile, its settings are automatically set to default settings — notification and privacy settings from one profile don’t carry over to your other profiles.  Additionally, some settings are managed separately for each profile, such as choosing who can see that profile’s posts or who can send friend requests to that profile.  We recommend checking your privacy settings for each new profile you create, and you can update privacy settings for your profiles at any time. Your main Facebook profile won’t show that you have additional personal profiles.\nOur longstanding policy on Account Integrity and Authentic Identity states that your main Facebook profile must be in the name you go by in everyday life — and this is not changing. You can choose any name for your additional profiles, but not for your main profile. We remain committed to preventing impersonation and identity misrepresentation, so additional profiles cannot impersonate others or be used to misrepresent your identity (including your age or location).",

Kids today are using devices from early ages, and on average, most teens use about 40 different apps every week. This week, we’re kicking off a series of workshops called Screen Smart to empower parents to confidently manage their teens’ usage of smartphones and devices – including on Meta’s platforms.\nAt Meta, we’ve developed more than 50 tools, resources and features to help teens create, explore and connect on our apps in safe, age-appropriate ways. This includes built-in protections for teens, like private accounts and messaging restrictions, as well supervision features so parents can set the right boundaries for their teens.\nHowever, we know that parenting online is more than just providing the right tools and protections. It’s also about building trust with your family when it comes to how they’re using smartphones and other devices, helping them navigate unwanted contact online, and approaching conversations about digital safety without being met with eye rolls.\n“Instagram and other social media platforms can be great ways to find community, connect with friends, learn new skills and express yourself. Many teens share with me that they ‘find their people’ online. For parents, it’s important to learn about the tools the platforms offer to help their teen have a positive experience. For example, parents can help teens with their content recommendation settings, time management settings and set up parental supervision if it’s right for them.” – Screen Smart speaker, pediatrician and adolescent medicine specialist, Dr. Hina Talib\nThat’s why we first piloted the Screen Smart series last year with hundreds of creators, community leaders and parents in five cities: New York, Miami, Chicago, Nashville and Seattle. During these events, Adam Mosseri, Head of Instagram, and Meta’s Global Head of Safety, Antigone Davis, shared Meta’s ongoing efforts in this space. Attendees also heard from experts including child psychologist Dr. Ann-Louise Lockhart, pediatrician and adolescent medicine specialist Dr. Hina Talib and Dr. Katie Davis from University of Washington’s Digital Wellness Lab.\nWhether it’s through events like these, ad campaigns, in-app promotion or resources in our Meta Family Center, we’re always working to educate parents on our safety features and tools, and to advocate for legislation that puts parents in charge of teen app downloads.",

    "content": "Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg arrives at federal court in San Jose, California, on Dec. 20, 2022.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMeta’s return-to-office mandate went into effect Tuesday, requiring employees to work from the company’s physical locations at least three days a week.The company began notifying employees in June of the coming change, which will not affect Meta’s current roster of remote workers. Any employee assigned to an office, however, will need to comply with the rules starting this week.“We believe that distributed work will continue to be important in the future, particularly as our technology improves,” a Meta spokesperson told CNBC on Tuesday in a statement. “In the near-term, our in-person focus is designed to support a strong, valuable experience for our people who have chosen to work from the office, and we’re being thoughtful and intentional about where we invest in remote work.”Facebook parent Meta first extended its remote-work policy to all full-time employees in June 2021. During the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company learned that “good work can get done anywhere, and I’m even more optimistic that remote work at scale is possible, particularly as remote video presence and virtual reality continue to improve.”But since then, many tech giants, such as Amazon and Google parent Alphabet, have reversed course on previous remote work policies, calling on staffers to return to physical offices at least three days a week or potentially face consequences. At Amazon, some employees are being told to relocate to different states to keep their roles, and some have quit rather than adhering to those demands.As part of Meta’s “Year of Efficiency,” Zuckerberg hinted in a March blog post that he was going to update Meta’s policy after the company conducted an internal analysis that showed engineers who work in person “get more done.”“Our early analysis of performance data suggests that engineers who either joined Meta in-person and then transferred to remote or remained in-person performed better on average than people who joined remotely,” Zuckerberg wrote at the time. “This analysis also shows that engineers earlier in their career perform better on average when they work in-person with teammates at least three days a week.”WATCH: Meta can generate ‘significantly more earnings’",

    "content": "Meta will start labelling AI-generated photos uploaded to Facebook, Instagram, and Threads over the coming months as election season ramps up around the world. The company will also begin punishing users who don’t disclose if a realistic video or piece of audio was made with AI.Nick Clegg, Meta’s president of global affairs, said in an interview that these steps are meant to “galvanize” the tech industry as AI-generated media becomes increasingly difficult to discern from reality. The White House has pushed hard for companies to watermark AI-generated content. In the meantime, Meta is building tools to detect synthetic media even if its metadata has been altered to obfuscate AI’s role in its creation, according to Clegg.Meta already applies an “Imagined with AI” watermark to images created with its own Imagine AI generator, and the company will begin doing the same to AI-generated photos made with tools from Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, Adobe, Midjourney, and Shutterstock. Clegg said the industry is farther behind on building standards to identify AI-generated video and audio. and that, while Meta is on high alert for how such media can be used to deceive, the company isn’t going to be able to catch everything on its own.“For those who are worried about video, audio content being designed to materially deceive the public on a matter of political importance in the run-up to the election, we’re going to be pretty vigilant,” he said. “Do I think that there is a possibility that something may happen where, however quickly it’s detected or quickly labeled, nonetheless we’re somehow accused of having dropped the ball? Yeah, I think that is possible, if not likely.”An example of a watermarked AI image made with Meta’s free tool. The VergeMeta has been working with groups like Partnership on AI to build on existing content authenticity initiatives. Adobe recently released the Content Credentials system that puts content provenance information into the metadata of images. And Google extended its SynthID watermark to audio files after releasing it in beta for images. Clegg said Meta will soon begin requiring that its users disclose when realistic video or audio posts are made with AI. If they don’t, “the range of penalties that will apply will run the full gamut from warnings through to removal” of the offending post, he said.There are already plenty of examples of viral, AI-generated posts of politicians, but Clegg downplayed the chances of the phenomena overrunning Meta’s platform in an election year. “I think it’s really unlikely that you’re going to get a video or audio which is entirely synthetic of very significant political importance which we don’t get to see pretty quickly,” he said. “I just don’t think that’s the way that it’s going to play out.”Meta is also starting to internally test the use of large language models (LLMs) trained on its Community Standards, he said, calling it an efficient “triage mechanism” for its tens of thousands of human moderators. “It appears to be a highly effective and rather precise way of ensuring that what is escalated to our human reviewers really is the kind of edge cases for which you want human judgment.”",

    "content": "Updated on April 3, 2024:\nWe have made further investments in expanding our third-party fact checker network in India ahead of the General Elections 2024. We have added Press Trust of India’s (PTI) dedicated fact-checking unit within the newswire’s editorial department to our already robust network of independent fact-checkers in the country. The partnership will enable PTI to identify, review and rate content as misinformation across Meta platforms.\nWe now have 12 partners across India covering 16 Indian languages and English, making it our largest network for a country.\nAs the world’s largest democracy prepares for the 18th General Elections, Meta will continue efforts to limit misinformation, remove voter interference, and enhance transparency and accountability on our platforms to support free and fair elections. Towards this, we have around 40,000 people globally working on safety and security, with more than $20 billion invested in teams and technology in this area since 2016. This includes 15,000 content reviewers who review content across Facebook, Instagram, and Threads in more than 70 languages — including 20 Indian languages. With lessons learnt from hundreds of elections globally and with so many more important elections approaching this year, we have developed a comprehensive approach on our platforms.\nOver the last eight years, we’ve rolled out industry-leading transparency tools for ads about social issues, elections or politics, developed comprehensive policies to prevent election interference and voter fraud, and built the largest third party fact-checking programme of any social media platform, to help combat the spread of misinformation. More recently, we have committed to taking a responsible approach to new technologies like GenAI. We’ll be drawing on all of these resources in the run up to the elections.\nAs for all major elections, we’ll also activate an India-specific Elections Operations Center, bringing together experts from across the company from our intelligence, data science, engineering, research, operations, content policy and legal teams to identify potential threats and put specific mitigations in place across our apps and technologies in real time.\nWe are closely engaged with the Election Commission of India via the Voluntary Code of Ethics that we joined in 2019, which gives the Commission a high priority channel to flag unlawful content to us.\nWe remove the most serious kinds of misinformation from Facebook, Instagram and Threads, such as content that could suppress voting, or contribute to imminent violence or physical harm. During the Indian elections, based on guidance from local partners, this will include false claims about someone from one religion physically harming or harassing another person or group from a different religion. For content that doesn’t violate these particular policies, we work with independent fact-checking organizations. We are continuing to expand our network of independent fact-checkers in the country – we now have 11 partners across India covering 16 languages, making it one of our largest networks for a country.\nAhead of the elections period, we will make it easier for all our fact-checking partners across India to find and rate content related to the elections, because we recognize that speed is especially important during breaking news events. We’ll use keyword detection to make it easier for fact-checkers to find and rate misinformation. Our fact checking partners are also being onboarded to our new research tool, Meta Content Library, which has a powerful search capability to support them in their work. Indian fact checking partners are the first amongst our global network of fact checkers to have access to Meta Content Library.\na) Countering risks emanating from the misuse of GenAI\nWe recognize the concerns around the misuse of AI-generated content to spread misinformation and  actively monitor new trends in content to update our policies. Our Community Standards and Community Guidelines govern the types of content and behaviors that are acceptable on Facebook and Instagram, applying to all content on our platforms, including content generated by AI. When we find content that violates our Community Standards or Community Guidelines, we remove it whether it was created by AI or a person.\nAI generated content is also eligible to be reviewed and rated by our network of independent fact-checkers. Many of our fact checking partners are trained in visual verification techniques, such as reverse image searching and analyzing the image metadata that indicates when and where the photo or video was taken. They can rate a piece of content as  ‘Altered’, which includes “faked, manipulated or transformed audio, video, or photos.” Once a piece of content is rated as ‘altered’, or we detect it as near identical, it appears lower in Feed on Facebook. We also dramatically reduce the content’s distribution. On Instagram, altered content gets filtered out of Explore and is featured less prominently in feed and stories. This significantly reduces the number of people who see it.\nFor content that doesn’t violate our policies, we still believe it’s important for people to know when photorealistic content they’re seeing has been created using AI. We already label photorealistic images created using Meta AI by putting visible markers that you can see on the images, and both invisible watermarks and metadata embedded within image files. We are also building tools to label AI generated images from Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, Adobe, Midjourney, and Shutterstock that users post to Facebook, Instagram and Threads.\nStarting this year, we also require advertisers globally to disclose when they use AI or digital methods to create or alter a political or social issue ad in certain cases. This applies if the ad contains a photorealistic image or video, or realistic sounding audio, that was digitally created or altered to depict a real person as saying or doing something they did not say or do. It also applies if an ad depicts a realistic-looking person that does not exist or a realistic-looking event that did not happen, alters footage of a real event, or depicts a realistic event that allegedly occurred, but that is not a true image, video, or audio recording of the event.\nb) Consumer education initiatives to combat the spread of misinformation\nWe understand that it is important to educate people on the role they can play to curb the spread of misinformation. We have been running an integrated 8-week long safety campaign, ‘Know What’s Real,’ since the end of February. The campaign is focused on educating users on identifying and addressing misinformation on WhatsApp and Instagram by promoting digital best practices and highlighting available safety tools, along with encouraging people to double-check information that sounds suspicious or inaccurate by sending it to WhatsApp tiplines.\nRecently, we joined forces with the Misinformation Combat Alliance (MCA) to introduce a WhatsApp helpline to deal with AI-generated misinformation, especially deep fakes, providing a platform for reporting and verifying suspicious media. The service will support multiple languages, enhancing accessibility for users across India. We’re also working with MCA to conduct training sessions for law enforcement officials and other stakeholders on advanced techniques of combating misinformation, including deep fakes using effective open source tools.\nWhatsApp will continue to limit peoples’ ability to forward messages and has announced last year that any message that has been forwarded once can only be forwarded to one group at a time, rather than the previous limit of five. When we introduced the same feature for highly forwarded messages in 2020, we reduced the number of these messages sent on WhatsApp globally by more than 70%.\nPeople can also control who can add them to group chats and have options to block and report unknown contacts, giving them even more control over their privacy.\nPreventing Voter Interference and Encouraging Civic Engagement\nWe’re continuing to connect people with details about voting while enforcing our policies against voter interference, electoral violence and misinformation about when, where, and how to vote in an election. We continually review and update our election-related policies which prohibit any election interference and voter interference. We have zero tolerance towards these violations including providing misleading dates of polling day, wrong information on process of voting, etc., and take action if content violates our Community Standards.\nWe don’t allow ads that contain content debunked by third party fact checkers. We also don’t allow ads that discourage people from voting in an election, that call into question the legitimacy of an upcoming or ongoing election, or with premature claims of election victory. Our ads review process has several layers of analysis and detection, both before and after an ad goes live, which you can read more about here.\nOne key area we focus on during elections is civic engagement and supporting efforts by the Election Commission of India to drive voter participation. Recently, on National Voters’ Day in January, we launched a nation-wide alert to encourage users to visit the ECI website to access authentic information about elections. Like with previous elections including last year’s 5 state elections, we will run Voting Day Reminders and encourage users to share they voted.\nApart from this, we will be launching the ‘Celebrate Each Vote’ campaign by joining hands with national and regional creators to encourage voter awareness and tackle voter apathy among their communities in local languages across the country. This will begin in late March and will target all voters, specially those voting for the first time and also debunk election related misinformation.\nSince 2018, we have provided industry-leading transparency for ads about social issues, elections or politics, and we continue to expand those efforts. We have long believed in the role that transparency plays in bringing more accountability to Meta and our advertisers. This is especially important for ads that can influence the way people think, act and vote. We continue to provide industry-leading efforts for ads about social issues, elections or politics. Since 2020, people have been able to decide if they want to see fewer ads on these.\nAdvertisers who run these ads are required to complete an authorization process and include a “paid for by” disclaimer. We provide information about advertiser targeting choices, and ads delivery, in the publicly available Ad Library. All social issue, electoral and political ads information is stored in the Ad Library for seven years.",

    "content": "Meta is the company formerly known as Facebook that Mark Zuckerberg first worked on while at Harvard, later dropping out to build the business. The story was popularized in the 2010 film \"The Social Network.\"Today Zuckerberg essentially owns Facebook and the rest of Meta with his majority stake, giving him primary control of the company and its divisions. Meta is publicly traded, so a single person or company does not technically own it. In early 2023, Meta earnings become more favorable after six straight quarters of losses. The company beat earnings estimates for Q1 and Q2 2023. Meta earnings are released quarterly. In March, Meta announced it laid off 10,000 workers in a second wave of 2023 job cuts. Zuckerberg said the company would also close around 5,000 of the job openings it had yet to fill.In an analysis of tech companies conducting mass layoffs since 2022, Insider found that after Twitter, Meta layoffs were the most drastic. The company trimmed its workforce by 24%.Next to Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg is likely the most well-known current or former Meta employee. Sandberg stepped down from her position as Meta's chief operating officer in June 2022. During her tenure, she pioneered her own brand of feminism and weathered high-profile scandals.Mark ZuckerbergMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg grew up outside New York City and dropped out of Harvard after founding Facebook. He's built it into a multibillion-dollar company while weathering numerous scandals and controversies.Zuckerberg's net worth is estimated to be around $108 billion. His fortunes are largely tied to Meta stock, and his wealth has risen and fallen alongside it.Priscilla Chan met Zuckerberg at Harvard University and married in 2012. Zuckerberg's wife spends most of her time on the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, which is the couple's philanthropy project.The Zuckerberg family includes three kids, Maxima, 7; August, 5; and baby Aurelia, born in March 2023. There's a recurring theme that ties their three daughters' names together: all are linked to the names of Roman emperors, a part of history that fascinates Zuckerberg.Instagram and WhatsappMeta started simply as \"The Facebook,\" but the company has since grown into more. Besides Facebook, Meta apps include WhatsApp, Instagram, Threads, and the Horizon Metaverse.WhatsApp might be a little-known messaging app in the US, but in many parts of the globe, it's an essential part of everyday life. The Facebook-owned app is easily one of the most popular messaging services in the world.Most people are familiar with using WhatsApp via a mobile app on their phone, but not everyone is aware that it's also possible to use WhatsApp Web on a computer desktop, too. Built almost entirely around sharing images and videos, Instagram is a cultural powerhouse today with over a billion registered accounts and popular features like reels, stories, and threads. Small businesses, large institutions, news organizations, celebrities, photographers, musicians, and a cottage industry of influencers all use Instagram to communicate with a visual twist.The whole Meta ecosystem is tied together through various programs, including Meta Pay, which can be used when purchasing items, sending money, or donating to charitable causes on Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp.  Facebook About 3 billion users log into Facebook monthly. Facebook presences primarily consist of personal profiles or entity pages. You need a Facebook profile to create a Facebook page, but unlike profiles, which must be about a real person, a Facebook page can be about anything, from the ramen shop you manage to the band you promote.While many users take advantage of the mobile app, the Facebook desktop platform still allows users to post as well.Facebook Lite is also an app that's smaller in size than the regular Facebook app, which can be useful for people without access to a strong internet connection. Meta markets Facebook Lite as being compatible with speeds as low as 2G.FeaturesFacebook offers many features for customizing your online presence, connecting with friends, watching video content, and even building a business.You can easily personalize your profile to make it feel unique to you. A great place to start is changing your Facebook cover photo.You can also change your name on Facebook in the Settings section of the website or mobile app, which is useful if you've gotten married, adopted a new nickname, or made an error when you first set up your account. Facebook Messenger, now simply Messenger, is a popular messaging app that you can use to stay in touch with many of your friends, family, and coworkers. The advantage of Messenger is you only need to know someone's name or Facebook display name to contact them — no need to acquire an email address, phone number, or any other contact details.\nFacebook also offers its own dating service, baked into the Facebook mobile app. While it has a relatively modest user base, Facebook Dating is an attractive alternative because it leverages the existing Facebook audience and promises to more easily connect you with people who share your interests and activities. In addition, unlike almost any other dating app, it's free, with no premium features behind a paywall. Facebook Live allows you to watch or stream your own real-time or recorded videos. These streams can originate from friends or professional broadcast organizations, and both user groups can also post regular, pre-recorded video content to their timelines and stories.If you want to save videos you watch on Facebook to your phone or computer, there are ways to make Facebook video downloads via a mobile app or browser-based workaround on your computer.Business owners will find that Facebook business pages are free to both create and use. They can be a powerful tool to help you reach a new audience, gain popularity, and grow your brand.If you have multiple businesses or social media pages to manage, Meta Business Suite allows you to bulk upload content, plan content publication well beforehand, and coordinate marketing campaigns with partners. If you find yourself ready to delete a Facebook page — whether because the business closed, the band broke up, or you simply don't want a given page to be out there anymore — it's easy to delete Facebook pages via the main site and the Facebook app.Meta Portal, formerly called Facebook Portal, is an Alexa-enabled smart device used to video chat with friends and family. The Portal is like a dedicated video phone with a futuristic flare. The Portal has been discontinued, but the devices can still be purchased.Security & PrivacyWhile Facebook is convenient for connecting with people, it also holds more personal data than you may realize. If you don't have the right Facebook profile privacy settings, a lot of that personal data might be on public display.For security, it's also important to log out of Facebook occasionally, which you can do on one or all devices. It's a good habit to sign out of active sessions on all social media platforms to keep your accounts safe. It's also important to occasionally change your Facebook password. Doing so will safeguard against bad actors trying to access your account.Facebook also lets you block or unblock anyone quickly without alerting them. Unblocking someone on Facebook will even re-add them to your Friends list if you were friends before the block.Like most platforms, you'll sometimes find Facebook down unexpectedly. If the site or app isn't working, try refreshing your browser, clearing your cache, or reopen the app.\nSick of the whole social platform? You can deactivate or delete Facebook accounts to temporarily or permanently discontinue your presence on the site. And if you still have questions or an issue you can't troubleshoot, you can always contact Facebook customer support.Facebook MarketplaceSelling your stuff online has become a popular alternative to garage sales. For casual sellers, Facebook Marketplace is a free option that connects you with potential buyers in your area. You can get Facebook Marketplace on app or desktop platforms by clicking the Marketplace icon.Unfortunately, Marketplace's popularity also makes it an attractive destination for scams. Thankfully, if you know what to look for, scammers aren't hard to detect. Arm yourself with knowledge about the most common signs of Facebook Marketplace scams so you can buy and sell safely.MetaverseWhen Facebook changed its name to Meta in late 2021, it went all-in on its concept of a Metaverse. For most people, accessing Facebook's Metaverse, which is called Horizon, is as simple as buying a Meta Quest 2 VR headset. Oculus and Meta QuestPalmer Luckey was 20 years old when he founded the virtual reality company Oculus VR in 2012. And two years later, he sold it to Meta for $2 billion in cash and stock. Luckey began designing and building VR headsets in 2009 and completed the first prototype for what would become the first Oculus headset the following year in his parents' garage in Long Beach, California, when he was 17 years old.Luckey's first Oculus Rift virtual reality headset was released in 2013, and it was a watershed moment for technology fans everywhere. The then-cutting-edge Oculus Rift DK1 was not the first VR headset ever created, but it was the first high-quality yet affordable VR system available to the general public.John Carmack served as consulting chief technology officer for Meta's virtual reality initiatives since 2019 when he transitioned from a full-time into a \"consulting\" role. He initially joined VR headset creator Oculus in 2013, and the company was acquired by Facebook, now known as Meta, in 2014. Meta later changed the name of the VR headset brand to Meta Quest.Meta VR products currently include two headsets, the Quest 2 and the Quest Pro. In June, the company announced it will release the Quest 3.The Meta Quest Pro is Meta's latest VR headset and has features aimed at professional customers rather than gamers and hobbyists. The Quest Pro has augmented reality capabilities integrating virtual elements into the real world. That makes this a so-called mixed-reality headset. Previously, the VR maker had also sold the Oculus Go, which is now discontinued.The Meta VR headset comes with a pair of Quest 2 controllers that you can use to interact with the virtual environment and play most games.To get started, you need to download Meta content, like games and apps to your headset. You have the option to play by casting Meta content to a PC, mobile phone, or TV to make your virtual reality screen a group experience. You can cast directly from the headset using the Camera in the app library or cast from the mobile app by tapping the Cast button at the top of the Meta Quest app in the Facebook website or app.Oculus Link is a feature built into Quest 2, the Meta VR headset that allows you to connect your Quest to a PC. While the Meta Quest 2 is a completely self-contained wireless VR headset that can run games and apps from the large Quest library, Link adds an additional dimension, letting you use your computer's substantially higher processing power to run more complex PC VR games. That's good news because there's an enormous library of games on Steam, originally developed for other VR headsets like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. They run perfectly on the Quest 2, giving gamers many options for additional Meta Quest games.It's important to know how to factory reset the Oculus 2, Quest, or any other headset if you plan to resell it to wipe all of your data.Oculus headsets can allow up to four accounts to have an Oculus headset on at any time. While secondary accounts can still purchase games and use apps, they cannot connect their Oculus account to the Oculus mobile app.Starting last year, it became possible once again to use an Oculus headset without needing to have a Facebook or Instagram account.",

    "content": "April 15, 2024April 15, 2024\nLater this year Meta will launch a new education product for Quest devices.\nIt will allow teachers, trainers and administrators to access a range of education-specific apps and features, and make it possible for them to manage multiple Quest devices at once.\nThe new product is the result of extensive consultation and collaboration with educators, researchers and third-party developers working in the education space around the world.\nOf all the ways in which metaverse technologies like virtual, mixed and augmented reality could prove to be transformative, the potential they have for education is one of the most exciting.\nFor most of us, learning is social – we learn from and with others, and from each other’s experiences. It’s about interaction and discussion as much as it is about absorbing facts. That’s why the unique feeling of presence and immersion these technologies create can be so impactful in education.\nThey also make things possible that are impossible in the physical world. Instead of telling students what the dinosaurs were like, they can walk among them. Virtual science laboratories can be built and filled with equipment that most schools would never be able to afford. Classes can go on field trips to the best museums, no matter how far away they are. And they can be used to take the risk out of otherwise dangerous or expensive technical or vocational training.\nLast year, I wrote about some of the ingenious ways teachers and trainers were already using these technologies. That momentum has continued to build, with more and more colleges and institutions incorporating them into their curriculums. For example:\nNew Mexico State University is teaching criminal justice by immersing students in virtual crime scenes to learn how to best investigate.\nStanford University is using virtual reality to teach its Business School students soft skills, like how to have a difficult conversation or how to nail an interview.\nThe University of Glasgow is teaching life sciences by placing students inside virtual intestines, to see how the body battles bacteria.\nThere is also a growing research base showing that learning in VR can improve students’ performance, as well as their levels of engagement, attendance and satisfaction. In 2022, Morehouse College reported that students who learned in VR had an average final test score of 85, versus 78 in person. A survey by the XR Association found that 77% of educators believe these technologies ignite curiosity and improve engagement in class.\nTo make it easier for educators, later this year Meta will be launching a new product offering for Quest devices dedicated to education, just as last year’s Meta Quest for Business was designed for the workplace. It will allow teachers, trainers and administrators to access a range of education-specific apps and features, and make it possible for them to manage multiple Quest devices at once, without the need for each device in a classroom or training environment to be updated and prepared individually. This will save teachers time and allow students to pick up the headsets and get started right away – something that educators using our devices have consistently told us they want.\nEducation and training providers represent a considerable market for technology products, and we see a growing number of developers building and releasing apps aimed at this sector. While it is still early days for the use of immersive technologies in these settings, we think there’s scope for them to be adopted on a much wider scale.\nThe product’s name and features will be announced in the coming months. At launch, we plan to make the product available in our Quest for Business supported markets to institutions serving learners aged 13+.\nThe new product is the result of extensive consultation and collaboration with educators, researchers and third-party developers working in the education space around the world. We want it to be something that makes it easier for students to learn, apply and practice new skills; feel a sense of presence with teachers and classmates; and to visit places or experience things that would otherwise be impossible. Above all, we want it to help teachers do what they do best: teach. We will continue to learn from them so we can keep improving and make sure Meta Quest headsets are the best devices, at the best value, to bring their classes to life.",

    "content": "An icon in the shape of an angle pointing down.\nMark Zuckerberg is focusing more and more of Meta's efforts on commercializing AI.\nMeta said in June that it wanted workers to come into the office three days a week.\nNow the company is insisting that most workers come back to the office or face the consequences.\nA failure to do so could lead an employee to lose their job, an internal note said.\nAccess your favorite topics in a personalized feed while you're on the go.\nMeta is committing to its return-to-office mandate, telling employees that they will be monitored by management to make sure they comply and that they may lose their jobs if they don't.The company, formerly known as Facebook, on Thursday afternoon updated employees on its guidance for an RTO policy announced in June. Lori Goler, Meta's head of human resources, wrote in a post to Workplace, the company's internal forum, that all employees \"assigned to an office\" would be required to work from that office or otherwise participate in in-person work at least three days a week. Employees already approved for fully remote work do not have to comply with the mandate.\"Accountability will be central to making this fair and effective,\" Goler wrote.Managers at Meta will be responsible for following up with workers on a monthly basis, making sure they are complying with the policy. Workers may be disciplined or even lose their jobs if they repeatedly fail to comply.\"Managers will review badge and Status Tool information on a monthly basis and follow up with those who didn't meet the requirement, subject to local law and works council requirements,\" Goler wrote. \"As with other company policies, repeated violations may result in disciplinary action, up to and including a performance rating drop and, ultimately, termination if not addressed.\"\"We believe that distributed work will continue to be important in the future, particularly as our technology improves,\" a spokesman for Meta said.\n\"In the near-term, our in-person focus is designed to support a strong, valuable experience for our people who have chosen to work from the office, and we're being thoughtful and intentional about where we invest in remote work,\" he added.Meta first informed employees of its RTO efforts in June, saying that beginning after the Labor Day holiday, people who were hired to work in an office should return for at least part of the week.The internal announcement came after CEO Mark Zuckerberg began to publicly and internally praise the benefits of in-office work. In a March memo announcing a layoff of 10,000 employees, he wrote that a company analysis found that \"engineers earlier in their career perform better on average when they work in-person with teammates at least three days a week.\" The details of the analysis were not shared.Under the new policy, most new employees, save for those hired for rare fully remote roles, will be required to work in the office. After 18 months, and with positive performance reviews, workers can apply to be fully remote. Being fully remote means Meta will not maintain desk space for such workers, who should not come to an office \"more than 4 days every 2 months,\" Goler's memo said,While Meta still allows some remote work, the overall shift away from it is a major departure from the pro-remote-work stance it adopted early on in the pandemic. In an interview discussing Meta's long-term strategy on \"The Tim Ferriss Show\" in March 2022, Zuckerberg said on the podcast that he hoped to have \"50% or more of the company\" working \"distributed and working remotely\" by the end of the decade. And Meta's metaverse was supposed to further usher in an era of remote-work options.Read the full note below:From: Lori GolerDistributed work updatesTL;DR:• We shared in June that beginning September 5, people assigned to an office will need to spend at least 3 days per week in person to foster healthy relationships and strong collaboration.• Managers will hold their teams accountable to the In-Person Time Policy on a monthly basis. You won't need to make up in-person time when you're off work (e.g., paid time off, sick time, unforeseen circumstances like a family emergency) or when you take Global or Domestic Travel Days.• Unless required for work reasons, remote workers should limit office visits to no more than 4 days every 2 months to help teams build predictable schedules and more consistent collaboration practices.Everyone must keep the Status Tool updated with their correct work location.As we shared in June, beginning September 5, people assigned to an office need to spend at least 3 days per week working in person to foster healthy relationships and strong collaboration. Consistency is key for teams to optimize how they work together, so we're also building more structure and clear guidelines around remote workers visiting the office. We're providing an overview of how we'll hold office workers accountable for the in-person time requirement, guidance and changes for remote workers, our approach to location strategy, and reminders about the office experience. More details and FAQs can be found on the People Portal.IN-PERSON TIME• On September 5, the In-Person Time Policy will take effect. People assigned to an office are required to be in the office, or engaging in other in-person activities like meeting with clients, at least 3 days per week. Some orgs will set a schedule of preferred in-office days, so please prioritize coming in then to make collaboration easier.• Accountability will be central to making this fair and effective. Managers will review badge and Status Tool information on a monthly basis and follow up with those who didn't meet the requirement, subject to local law and works council requirements. As with other company policies, repeated violations may result in disciplinary action, up to and including a Performance@ rating drop and, ultimately, termination if not addressed.• We know there will be weeks when you can't work in person for 3 days, like if you take PTO or sick days, have jury duty, or when there are company holidays - you won't need to make up in-person time for these reasons. Unforeseen circumstances, such as family emergencies or dangerous commute conditions, will also count. You can continue to use Global and Domestic Travel Days, but only 20 combined Global or Domestic Travel Days would count towards your in-person time for the year. We trust everyone to use good judgment and act in the spirit of the policy, and will address outliers as needed. REMOTE WORKOffice visits:• Remote work is for people who are committed to working from home, and isn't intended for those who want to spend regular time in the office. To help teams build predictable collaboration practices, we're asking remote workers not to visit the office more than 4 days every 2 months- unless there's a clear business reason (team onsite, required in- person meetings) or to attend Meta-sponsored events like Company All Hands, Metamate Meetups, or Hackathons.• Managers will review this monthly, subject to local law and works council requirements, and remote workers who consistently exceed the threshold will be required to transfer to an office and meet the minimum 3 days/week in-person requirement.Remote applications:• We're moving to a monthly review cycle for remote work applications by org leaders so they can fully assess and understand the impact of these requests on their organizations and sites as they implement their org-specific location strategy. Cross-border remote requests are still on hold until Q4.• Applications submitted from today through the end of September will be reviewed by the end of October, and monthly after that. Remote applications submitted before August 17 will move forward pending manager approval.STATUS TOOL• Everyone - both office and remote workers - must keep the Status Tool updated with your work location, ideally 2 weeks in advance. This makes it easier to coordinate time with your team, lets Calendar manage your meeting rooms, helps Facilities plan effectively, allows Meta to withhold your taxes accurately, and ensures your in-person time is reflected correctly in monthly reports to your manager.• To make this easier, you can set your status in advance. Beginning September 5, you'll be able to regularly review your own data in the tool to confirm you're meeting the in-person requirements.LOCATION STRATEGY• We're focusing on team co-location to maximize the value of in-person time. Org leaders continue to formalize location strategies and will share more in the coming weeks. Leaders can include global office locations and remote work (internal only) as part of their strategy.Org location strategy will be used to guide future hiring and transfer decisions. You won't be asked to move or transfer if you work from somewhere that's not part of your org's new location strategy, including remote.• Locations for all external roles will be updated by mid-September. As we shared in June, we'll limit external remote hiring to rare, approved candidate exceptions. While we work to make internal-only remote roles visible, please reach out to the hiring manager to confirm if remote is an option.Are you a Meta employee or someone else with insight to share?

    "content": "Facebook’s parent company Meta will pay Texas $1.4 billion to settle a lawsuit that accused the company of using personal biometric data without users’ authorization.\nThe 2022 lawsuit, filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton in state court, alleged that Meta had been using facial recognition software on photos uploaded to Facebook without Texans’ consent.\nPaxton’s office said this is the largest settlement ever obtained by a single state and the largest related to privacy ever secured by a state attorney general. The settlement will be paid over five years. The attorney general’s office did not say whether the money from the settlement would go into the state’s general fund or if it would be distributed in some other way.\n“This historic settlement demonstrates our commitment to standing up to the world’s biggest technology companies and holding them accountable for breaking the law and violating Texans’ privacy rights. Any abuse of Texans’ sensitive data will be met with the full force of the law,” Paxton said in a statement.\nThe settlement, announced Tuesday, does not act as an admission of guilt and Meta maintains no wrongdoing.\nThis was the first lawsuit Paxton’s office argued under a 2009 state law that protects Texans’ biometric data, like fingerprints and facial scans. The law requires businesses to inform and get consent from individuals before collecting such data. It also limits sharing this data, except in certain cases like helping law enforcement or completing financial transactions. Businesses must protect this data and destroy it within a year after it's no longer needed.\nIn 2011, Meta introduced a feature known as Tag Suggestions to make it easier for users to tag people in their photos. According to Paxton’s office, the feature was turned on by default and ran facial recognition on users’ photos, automatically capturing data protected by the 2009 law. That system was discontinued in 2021, with Meta saying it deleted over 1 billion people’s individual facial recognition data.\nAs part of the settlement, Meta must notify the attorney general’s office of anticipated or ongoing activities that may fall under the state’s biometric data laws. If Texas objects, the parties have 60 days to attempt to resolve the issue.\nMeta officials said the settlement will make it easier for the company to discuss the implications and requirements of the state’s biometric data laws with the attorney general’s office, adding that data protection and privacy are core priorities for the firm.\n“We are pleased to resolve this matter, and look forward to exploring future opportunities to deepen our business investments in Texas, including potentially developing data centers,” a Meta spokesperson said Tuesday.\nMeta has about a month to pay the first installment of $500 million to the state. Subsequent installments of $225 million each will be paid annually from 2025 to 2028.\nConsumer Reports, a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization, commended Paxton for the lawsuit but noted it was an outliner. In a statement, the group said that states have brought too few cases against privacy violations.\n“As companies compete to build large-scale AI models, the scramble for consumer data threatens to become a race to the bottom, so enforcement agencies must keep a watchful eye for unfair data collection practices,” said Matt Schwartz, a policy analyst at Consumer Reports.\nThe settlement comes at a time when big tech is growing its presence in Texas — and amid state efforts to regulate the industry.\nLast year, state legislators passed the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act, which went into effect at the beginning of this month and requires businesses to get permission from users for processing sensitive personal data. It also grants consumers rights to access and delete their data as well as stop data collection.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court recently sent a legal challenge to Texas' social media law — which prevents large social media companies from censoring users' content based on political viewpoints — back to a lower court for further analysis.\nPaxton sued Google in 2022, alleging that the company illegally stored data on facial geometry and voiceprints without informing users. Similar lawsuits in Illinois and Arizona resulted in substantial settlements.\nIn 2020, Texas led 15 states in an antitrust lawsuit against Google, which is expected to go to court next year. The state also participated in a separate lawsuit over Android app distribution and payment processing last year, with Google paying $700 million to settle. In addition, Google settled a deceptive advertising claim with Texas in 2023 for $8 million.\nTexas has supported Epic Games' antitrust lawsuit against Apple, claiming the company’s app distribution and payment monopolization stifles competition.\nConsumer Reports encouraged Paxton to pursue rigorous enforcement of the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act.\nDisclosure: Apple, Facebook and Google have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors. Financial supporters play no role in the Tribune's journalism.

    "content": "With over 100 million downloads of Llama models to date, a lot of this innovation is being fueled by open models. In order to build trust in the developers driving this new wave of innovation, we’re launching Purple Llama, an umbrella project that will bring together tools and evaluations to help developers build responsibly with open generative AI models.\nWhy purple? Borrowing a concept from the cybersecurity world, we believe that to truly mitigate the challenges that generative AI presents, we need to take both attack (red team) and defensive (blue team) postures. Purple teaming, composed of both red and blue team responsibilities, is a collaborative approach to evaluating and mitigating potential risks.\nTo start, Purple Llama will include tools and evaluations for cybersecurity and input/output safeguards, with more to come in the near future. Components within the Purple Llama project will be licensed permissively enabling both research and commercial use. We believe this is a major step in enabling collaboration among developers and standardizing trust and safety tools for generative AI.\nWe are sharing what we believe is the first industry-wide set of cyber security safety evaluations for Large Language Models (LLMs). These benchmarks are based on industry guidance and standards and are built in collaboration with our security experts. With this initial release, we aim to provide tools that will help address risks outlined in the White House commitments including:\nMetrics for quantifying LLM cybersecurity risk\nTools to evaluate the frequency of insecure code suggestions\nTools to evaluate LLMs to make it harder to generate malicious code or aid in carrying out cyber attacks\nWe believe these tools will reduce the frequency of insecure AI-generated code suggested by LLMs and reduce the helpfulness of LLMs to cyber adversaries.\nAs we outlined in Llama 2’s Responsible Use Guide, we recommend that all inputs and outputs to the LLM be checked and filtered in accordance with content guidelines appropriate to the application.\nTo support this, we are releasing Llama Guard, an openly available foundational model to help developers avoid generating potentially risky outputs. As part of our ongoing commitment to open and transparent science, we are releasing our methodology and an extended discussion of our results in our paper. This model has been trained on a mix of publicly available datasets to enable detection of common types of potentially risky or violating content. Ultimately, our vision is to enable developers to customize future versions to support relevant use cases based on their own requirements and make it easier to adopt best practices and improve the open ecosystem.\nTaking an open approach to AI is not new for Meta. Exploratory research, open science and cross-collaboration are foundational to our AI efforts and we believe there’s an important opportunity to create an open ecosystem. This collaborative mindset was at the forefront when Llama 2 launched in July with over 100 partners and we’re excited to share that many of those same partners are working with us on open trust and safety including: AI Alliance, AMD, Anyscale, AWS, Bain, Cloudflare, Databricks, Dell Technologies, Dropbox, Google Cloud, Hugging Face, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, MLCommons, Nvidia, Oracle, Orange, Scale AI, Together.AI and many more to come.\nWe’re excited to collaborate with our partners and others who share the same vision of an open ecosystem of responsibly-developed generative AI.",

    "content": "Meta is challenging the European Commission’s decision to regulate two of its services, Messenger and Marketplace, as gatekeepers under the bloc’s tough new restrictions on tech platforms. The company filed an appeal over the two services today arguing that neither should qualify, Meta spokesperson Chris Sgro told The Verge.Reuters reported earlier Meta will not fight the European Commission’s gatekeeper designation from being applied to Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.Being designated as a gatekeeper under the Digital Markets Act means that tech platforms have to abide by certain neutrality and openness rules. Messaging services like Meta’s Messenger need to be made interoperable with other messaging services; sales platforms like Meta’s Marketplace need to abide by rules that protect the merchants who use it.Meta says Messenger isn’t distinct from FacebookBoth platforms meet the usage numbers that would qualify them as gatekeepers, but Meta argues that they should be exempted because of other distinctions. Meta argues that Messenger is a feature of Facebook and not a messaging platform unto itself (an interesting position given that the apps were split apart for close to a decade and only reunited earlier this year). Marketplace shouldn’t qualify, Meta says, because it’s a consumer-to-consumer service without Meta sitting in the middle.The deadline is tomorrow for tech companies to appeal the European Commission’s gatekeeper designations. The Financial Times reports that a court is expected the rule on the appeals within months, ahead of the March 6th deadline to comply with the regulations. Apple is expected to appeal at least one of its own designations, too.“This appeal seeks clarification on specific points of law regarding the designations of Messenger and Marketplace under the DMA. It does not alter or detract from our firm commitment to complying with the DMA, and we will continue to work constructively with the European Commission to prepare for compliance,” Sgro told The Verge in an emailed statement.Featured Videos From The VergeSamsung Galaxy Watch Ultra: ring any bells?The $649.99 Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra doesn’t hide where it got its inspiration from, but it is the first to have FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection.",

    "content": "Today, we’re releasing Code Llama, a large language model (LLM) that can use text prompts to generate and discuss code. Code Llama is state-of-the-art for publicly available LLMs on coding tasks. It has the potential to make workflows faster and more efficient for developers and lower the barrier to entry for people who are learning to code. Code Llama has the potential to be used as a productivity and educational tool to help programmers write more robust, well-documented software.\nWe believe an open approach to AI is best for developing new AI tools that are innovative, safe and responsible, so we’re releasing Code Llama for both research and commercial use under the same community license as Llama 2.\nCode Llama is a code-specialized version of Llama 2 that was created by further training Llama 2 on its code-specific datasets, sampling more data from that same dataset for longer. Essentially, Code Llama features enhanced coding capabilities. It can generate code and natural language about code, from both code and natural language prompts (e.g., “Write me a function that outputs the fibonacci sequence”). It can also be used for code completion and debugging. It supports many of the most popular programming languages used today, including Python, C++, Java, PHP, Typescript (Javascript), C#, Bash and more.\nWe are releasing three sizes of Code Llama with 7B, 13B and 34B parameters respectively. Each of these models is trained with 500B tokens of code and code-related data. The 7B and 13B base and instruct models have also been trained with fill-in-the-middle (FIM) capability, allowing them to insert code into existing code, meaning they can support tasks like code completion right out of the box.\nThe three models address different serving and latency requirements. The 7B model, for example, can be served on a single GPU. The 34B model returns the best results and allows for better coding assistance, but the smaller 7B and 13B models are faster and more suitable for tasks that require low latency, like real-time code completion.\nWe also further fine-tuned two additional variations of Code Llama: Code Llama – Python and Code Llama – Instruct.\nCode Llama – Python is a language specialized variation of Code Llama, further fine-tuned on 100B tokens of Python code. Because Python is the most benchmarked language for code generation, and because Python and PyTorch play an important role in the AI community – we believe a specialized model provides additional utility.\nCode Llama – Instruct is an instruction fine-tuned and aligned variation of Code Llama. Instruction tuning continues the training process, but with a different objective. The model is fed a natural language instruction input and the expected output. This makes it better at understanding what people expect out of their prompts. We recommend using Code Llama – Instruct variants whenever using Code Llama for code generation since Code Llama – Instruct has been fine-tuned to generate helpful and safe answers in natural language.\nProgrammers are already using LLMs to assist in a variety of tasks. The goal is to make developer workflows more efficient so that they can focus on the most human-centric aspects of their job, rather than repetitive tasks. We believe that AI models, and LLMs for coding in particular, benefit most from an open approach, both in terms of innovation and safety. Publicly available, code-specific models can facilitate the development of new technologies that improve peoples’ lives. By releasing code models like Code Llama, the entire community can evaluate their capabilities, identify issues and fix vulnerabilities.\nCode Llama is designed to support software engineers in all sectors — including research, industry, open source projects, NGOs and businesses. But there are still many more use cases to support. We hope Code Llama will inspire others to leverage Llama 2 to create new innovative tools for research and commercial products.",

    "content": "An important note for Facebook advertisers, with Meta announcing that it’ll be removing and/or consolidating some of its detailed ad targeting options, either because they’re not widely used, are too granular, or they relate to topics that “people may perceive as sensitive.”\n“Starting January 15, 2024, we’re removing or consolidating some detailed targeting options that relate to topics people may perceive as sensitive. Existing ad sets with impacted targeting options will continue to run until March 18 2024, but will require you to update your targeting selections. After this date, we will stop delivering ads to the discontinued detailed targeting options, and impacted ad sets may be paused.”\nMeta says that the “sensitive” options relate to interests that target elements aligned with health, race, and/or ethnicity.\nWhich makes sense, especially given the various challenges Meta has faced in the past over unethical, and even illegal use of its ad targeting options.\nBut it could have an impact on your process, and how you get your Facebook and IG ads in front of the right people.\nMeta hasn’t provided specific details of the categories being removed, so it’s hard to measure the potential impact, and the full scope of the changes being rolled out. But it’s another step away from manual, granular ad targeting, which, inevitably, can be used for discriminatory targeting, in various ways.\nFor example, while you can’t target people based on race, you can target users residing in certain regions, which some would suggest could lead to, effectively, the same result. Given this, there’s no way for Meta to fully remove all forms of questionable audience targeting, while over time, Meta has also continued to improve its automated ad targeting tools, to the point where giving advertisers more manual options is actually, often, more restrictive.\nMeta would prefer that marketers use its broad targeting and Advantage+ options instead, which put more reliance on Meta’s systems, and will often drive better performance, by showing your ads to users you may not have targeted yourself.\nSo while Meta is removing more and more targeting categories over time, you could be better off relying on its systematic display options instead. Which, eventually, seems like it will become the only option for brands.\nIn any event, it’s worth noting this latest change for your Facebook and IG ads.\nMeta says that impacted advertisers will see a warning notification in Ads Manager, alerting them if any of their campaigns require updating after the change goes into effect. Meta also notes that it’ll provide alternative targeting recommendations where possible.",

    "content": "This Article is available as a video essay on YouTube\nApple released the Vision Pro on February 2; 12 days later Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivered his verdict:\nAlright guys, so I finally tried Apple’s Vision Pro. And you know, I have to say that before this, I expected that Quest would be the better value for most people since it’s really good and it’s like seven times less expensive. But after using it I don’t just think that Quest is the better value — I think the Quest is the better product, period.\nYou can watch the video for Zuckerberg’s full — and certainly biased! — take, but the pertinent section for this Article came towards the end:\nThe reality is that every generation of computing has an open and a closed model, and yeah, in mobile, Apple’s closed model won. But it’s not always that way. If you go back to the PC era, Microsoft’s open model was the winner, and in this next generation, Meta is going to be the open model, and I really want to make sure that the open model wins out again. The future is not yet written.\nJohn Gruber asked on Daring Fireball:\nAt the end, he makes the case that each new generation of computing devices has an open alternative and a closed one from Apple. (It’s interesting to think that these rivalries might be best thought of not as closed-vs.-open, but as Apple-vs.-the-rest-of-the-industry.) I’m not quite sure where he’s going with that, though, because I don’t really see how my Quest 3 is any more “open” than my Vision Pro. Are they going to license the OS to other headset makers?\nSome updates on the metaverse today. We are releasing Meta Horizon OS, our operating system that powers Quest virtual and mixed reality headsets, and we are partnering with some of the best hardware companies out there to design new headsets that are optimized for all the different ways that people use this tech.\nNow, in every era of computing, there are always open and closed models. Apple’s closed model basically went out. Phones are tightly controlled and you’re kind of locked into what they’ll let you do. But it doesn’t have to be that way. In the PC era, the open model won out. You can do a lot more things, install mods. You got more diversity of hardware, software and more. So our goal is to make it so the open model defines the next generation of computing again with the metaverse, glasses and headsets. That’s why we’re releasing our operating systems so that more companies can build different things on it.\nIt’s natural to view this announcement as a reaction to the Vision Pro, or perhaps to Google’s upcoming AR announcment at Google I/O, which is rumored to include a new Samsung headset. However, I think that this sells Zuckerberg and Meta’s strategic acumen short: this is an obvious next step, of a piece with the company’s recent AI announcements, and a clear missing piece in the overall metaverse puzzle.\nAny question of strategy starts with understanding your market, so what is Meta’s? This is a trickier question than you might think, particularly on the Internet. It’s a definition that has particularly vexed regulators, as I laid out in Regulators and Reality; after describing why the FTC’s extremely narrow definition of “personal social networking” — which excluded everything from Twitter to Reddit to LinkedIn to TikTok to YouTube as Facebook competitors — didn’t make sense, I explained:\nThe far bigger problem, though, is that everything I just wrote is meaningless, because everything listed above is a non-rivalrous digital service with zero marginal costs and zero transactional costs; users can and do use all of them at the same time. Indeed, the fact that all of these services can and do exist for the same users at the same time makes the case that Facebook’s market is in fact phenomenally competitive.\nWhat, though, is Facebook competing for? Competition implies rivalry, that is, some asset that can only be consumed by one service to the exclusion of others, and the only rivalrous good in digital services is consumer time and attention. Users only have one set of eyes, and only 24 hours in a day, and every second spent with one service is a second not spent with another (although this isn’t technically true, since you could, say, listen to one while watching another while scrolling a third while responding to notifications from a fourth, fifth, and sixth). Note the percentages in this chart of platform usage:\nThe total is not 100, it is 372, because none of these services exclude usage of any of the others. And while Facebook is obviously doing well in terms of total users, TikTok in particular looms quite large when it comes to time, the only metric that matters:\nThis, of course, is why all of these services, including Instagram, Snapchat, and YouTube are trying to mimic TikTok as quickly as possible, which, last time I checked, is a competitive response, not a monopolistic one. You can even grant the argument that Facebook tried to corner the social media market — whatever that is — a decade ago, but you have to also admit that here in 2021 it is clear that they failed. Competition is the surest sign that there was not actually any anticompetitive conduct, and I don’t think it is the FTC’s job to hold Facebook management accountable for failing to achieve their alleged goals.\nThis idea that time and attention is the only scarce resource on the Internet, and thus the only market that truly matters, is what undergirds Netflix’s shift in reporting away from members and towards engagement; the company has been saying for years that its competitors were not just other streaming services, but everything from YouTube to Twitch streaming to video games to social media. That has always been true, if you squint, but on the Internet, where everything is only a click (or app) away, it’s tangible.\nDefining the relevant market as time and attention has surprising implications, that even companies raised on the Internet, including Meta, sometimes miss. Indeed, there was a time when Meta might have agreed with the FTC’s definition, because the company made competitive decisions — both big successes and big mistakes — predicated on the assumption that your personal social network was the market that mattered.\nStart with an Article I wrote in 2015 entitled Facebook and the Feed:\nZuckerberg is quite clear about what drives him; he wrote in Facebook’s S-1:\nFacebook was not originally created to be a company. It was built to accomplish a social mission – to make the world more open and connected.\nI am starting to wonder if these two ideas — company versus mission — might not be more in tension now than they have ever been in the past…I suspect that Zuckerberg for one subscribes to the first idea: that people find what others say inherently valuable, and that it is the access to that information that makes Facebook indispensable. Conveniently, this fits with his mission for the company. For my part, though, I’m not so sure. It’s just as possible that Facebook is compelling for the content it surfaces, regardless of who surfaces it. And, if the latter is the case, then Facebook’s engagement moat is less its network effects than it is that for almost a billion users Facebook is their most essential digital habit: their door to the Internet.\nA year later and Facebook responded to what was then its most pressing threat, Snapchat, by putting Stories into Instagram. I wrote in The Audacity of Copying Well:\nFor all of Snapchat’s explosive growth, Instagram is still more than double the size, with far more penetration across multiple demographics and international users. Rather than launch a “Stories” app without the network that is the most fundamental feature of any app built on sharing, Facebook is leveraging one of their most valuable assets: Instagram’s 500 million users.\nThe results, at least anecdotally, speak for themselves: I’ve seen more Instagram stories in the last 24 hours than I have Snapchat ones. Of course a big part of this is the novelty aspect, which will fade, and I follow a lot more people on Instagram than I do on Snapchat. That last point, though, is, well, the point: I and my friends are not exactly Snapchat’s target demographic today, but for the service to reach its potential we will be eventually. Unless, of course, Instagram Stories ends up being good enough.\nIt was good enough — Instagram arrested Snapchat’s growth, while boosting its own engagement and user base — so score one for Zuckerberg, right? Instagram had a better network, so they won…or did they simply have more preexisting usage, which while based on a network, was actually incidental to it?\nFast forward a few years and Facebook’s big competitor was TikTok; I wrote in 2020’s The TikTok War:\nAll of this explains what makes TikTok such a breakthrough product. First, humans like video. Second, TikTok’s video creation tools were far more accessible and inspiring for non-professional videographers. The crucial missing piece, though, is that TikTok isn’t really a social network…by expanding the library of available video from those made by your network to any video made by anyone on the service, Douyin/TikTok leverages the sheer scale of user-generated content to generate far more compelling content than professionals could ever generate, and relies on its algorithms to ensure that users are only seeing the cream of the crop.\nIn a follow-up Update I explained why this was a blindspot for Facebook:\nFirst, Facebook views itself first-and-foremost as a social network, so it is disinclined to see that as a liability. Second, that view was reinforced by the way in which Facebook took on Snapchat. The point of The Audacity of Copying Well is that Facebook leveraged Instagram’s social network to halt Snapchat’s growth, which only reinforced that the network was Facebook’s greatest asset, making the TikTok blindspot even larger.\nI am, in the end, actually making the same point as the previous section: Meta’s relevant market is user time and attention; it follows that Meta’s differentiation is the fact it marshals so much user time and attention, and that said marshaling was achieved via social networking is interesting but not necessarily strategically relevant. Indeed, Instagram in the end simply copied TikTok, surfacing content from anywhere on your network, and did so to great success.\nThis is the appropriate framework to understand Meta’s AI strategy with its Llama family of models: Llama 3 was released last week, and like Llama 2, it is open source, or, perhaps more accurately, open weights (with the caveat that hyperscalers need a license to offer Llama as a managed model). I explained why open weights makes sense in a May 2023 Update predicting the Llama 2 release:\nMeta isn’t selling its capabilities; rather, it sells a canvas for users to put whatever content they desire, and to consume the content created by other users. It follows, then, that Meta ought to be fairly agnostic about how and where that content is created; by extension, if Meta were to open source its content creation models, the most obvious place where the content of those models would be published is on Meta platforms. To put it another way, Meta’s entire business is predicated on content being a commodity; making creation into a commodity as well simply provides more grist for the mill.\nWhat is compelling about this reality, and the reason I latched onto Zuckerberg’s comments in that call, is that Meta is uniquely positioned to overcome all of the limitations of open source, from training to verification to RLHF to data quality, precisely because the company’s business model doesn’t depend on having the best models, but simply on the world having a lot of them.\nThe best analogy for Meta’s approach with Llama is what the company did in the data center. Google had revolutionized data center design in the 2000s, pioneering the use of commodity hardware with software-defined functionality; Facebook didn’t have the scale to duplicate Google’s differentiation in 2011, so it went in the opposite direction and created the Open Compute Project. Zuckerberg explained what happened next in an interview with Dwarkesh Patel:\nWe don’t tend to open source our product. We don’t take the code for Instagram and make it open source. We take a lot of the low-level infrastructure and we make that open source. Probably the biggest one in our history was our Open Compute Project where we took the designs for all of our servers, network switches, and data centers, and made it open source and it ended up being super helpful. Although a lot of people can design servers the industry now standardized on our design, which meant that the supply chains basically all got built out around our design. So volumes went up, it got cheaper for everyone, and it saved us billions of dollars which was awesome.\nZuckerberg then made the analogy I’m referring to:\nSo there’s multiple ways where open source could be helpful for us. One is if people figure out how to run the models more cheaply. We’re going to be spending tens, or a hundred billion dollars or more over time on all this stuff. So if we can do that 10% more efficiently, we’re saving billions or tens of billions of dollars. That’s probably worth a lot by itself. Especially if there are other competitive models out there, it’s not like our thing is giving away some kind of crazy advantage.\nIt’s not just about having a better model, though: it’s about ensuring that Meta doesn’t have a dependency on any one model as well. Zuckerberg continued:\nHere’s one analogy on this. One thing that I think generally sucks about the mobile ecosystem is that you have these two gatekeeper companies, Apple and Google, that can tell you what you’re allowed to build. There’s the economic version of that which is like when we build something and they just take a bunch of your money. But then there’s the qualitative version, which is actually what upsets me more. There’s a bunch of times when we’ve launched or wanted to launch features and Apple’s just like “nope, you’re not launching that.” That sucks, right? So the question is, are we set up for a world like that with AI? You’re going to get a handful of companies that run these closed models that are going to be in control of the APIs and therefore able to tell you what you can build?\nFor us I can say it is worth it to go build a model ourselves to make sure that we’re not in that position. I don’t want any of those other companies telling us what we can build. From an open source perspective, I think a lot of developers don’t want those companies telling them what they can build either. So the question is, what is the ecosystem that gets built out around that? What are interesting new things? How much does that improve our products? I think there are lots of cases where if this ends up being like our databases or caching systems or architecture, we’ll get valuable contributions from the community that will make our stuff better. Our app specific work that we do will then still be so differentiated that it won’t really matter. We’ll be able to do what we do. We’ll benefit and all the systems, ours and the communities’, will be better because it’s open source.\nThere is another analogy here, which is Google and Android; Bill Gurley wrote the definitive Android post in 2011 on his blog Above the Crowd:\nAndroid, as well as Chrome and Chrome OS for that matter, are not “products” in the classic business sense. They have no plan to become their own “economic castles.” Rather they are very expensive and very aggressive “moats,” funded by the height and magnitude of Google’s castle. Google’s aim is defensive not offensive. They are not trying to make a profit on Android or Chrome. They want to take any layer that lives between themselves and the consumer and make it free (or even less than free). Because these layers are basically software products with no variable costs, this is a very viable defensive strategy. In essence, they are not just building a moat; Google is also scorching the earth for 250 miles around the outside of the castle to ensure no one can approach it. And best I can tell, they are doing a damn good job of it.\nThe positive economic impact of Android (and Chrome) is massive: the company pays Apple around $20 billion a year for default placement on about 30% of worldwide smartphones (and Safari on Apple’s other platforms), which accounts for about 40% of the company’s overall spend on traffic acquisition costs across every other platform and browser. That total would almost certainly be much higher — if Google were even allowed to make a deal, which might not be the case if Microsoft controlled the rest of the market — absent Android and Chrome.\nAndroid is also a natural segue to this news about Horizon OS. Meta is, like Google before it, a horizontal services company funded by advertising, which means it is incentivized to serve everyone, and to have no one between itself and its customers. And so Meta is, like Google before it, spending a huge amount of money to build a contender for what Zuckerberg believes is a future platform. It’s also fair to note that Meta is spending a lot more than the $40 billion Google has put into Android, but I think it’s reasonable: the risk — and opportunity — for Meta in the metaverse is even higher than the risk Google perceived in smartphones.\nBack in 2013, when Facebook was facing the reality that mobile was ending its dreams of being a platform in its own right, I wrote Mobile Makes Facebook Just an App; That’s Great News:\nFirst off, mobile apps own the entire (small) screen. You see nothing but the app that you are using at any one particular time. Secondly, mobile apps are just that: apps, not platforms. There is no need for Facebook to “reserve space” in their mobile apps for partners or other apps. That’s why my quote above is actually the bull case for Facebook.\nSpecifically, it’s better for an advertising business to not be a platform. There are certain roles and responsibilities a platform must bear with regards to the user experience, and many of these work against effective advertising. That’s why, for example, you don’t see any advertising in Android, despite the fact it’s built by the top advertising company in the world. A Facebook app owns the entire screen, and can use all of that screen for what benefits Facebook, and Facebook alone.\nThis optimism was certainly borne out by Facebook’s astronomical growth over the last decade, which has been almost entirely about exploiting this mobile advertising opportunity. It also, at first glance, calls into question the wisdom of building Horizon OS, given the platform advertising challenges I just detailed.\nThe reality, though, is that a headset is fundamentally different than a smartphone: the latter is something you hold in a hand, and which an app can monopolize; the former monopolizes your vision, reducing an app to a window. Consider this PR image of the Vision Pro:\nThis isn’t the only canvas for apps in the Vision Pro: apps can also take over the entire view and provide an immersive experience, and I can imagine that Meta will, when and if the Vision Pro gains meaningful marketshare, build just that; remember, Meta is a horizontal services company, and that means serving everyone. Ultimately, though, Zuckerberg sees the chief allure of the metaverse as being about presence, which means the sensation of feeling like you are in the same place as other people enjoying the same experiences and apps; that, by extension, means owning the layer within which apps live — it means owning your entire vision.\nJust as importantly — probably most importantly, to Zuckerberg — owning the OS means not being subject to Apple’s dictate on what can or cannot be built, or tracked, or monetized. And, as Zuckerberg noted in that interview, Meta isn’t particularly keen to subject itself to Google, either. It might be tempting for Meta’s investors to dismiss these concerns, but ATT should have focused minds about just how much this lack of control can cost.\nFinally, not all devices will be platforms: Meta’s RayBan sunglasses, for example, could not be “just an app”; what they could be is that much better of a product if Apple made public the same sort of private APIs it makes available to its own accessories. Meta isn’t going to fix its smartphone challenges in that regard, but it is more motivation to do their own thing.\nMotivations, of course, aren’t enough: unlike AI models, where Meta wants a competitive model, but will achieve its strategic goals as long as a closed model doesn’t win, the company does actually need to win in the metaverse by controlling the most devices (assuming, of course, that the metaverse actually becomes a thing).\nThe first thing to note is that pursuing an Apple-like fully-integrated model would actually be bad for Meta’s larger goals, which, as a horizontal services company, is reaching the maximum number of people possible; there is a reason that the iPhone, by far the most dominant integrated product ever, still only has about 30% marketshare worldwide. Indeed, I would pushback on Zuckerberg’s continued insistence that Apple “won” mobile: they certainly did as far as revenue and profits go, but the nature of their winning is not the sort of winning that Meta should aspire to; from a horizontal services company perspective, Android “won” because it has the most marketshare.\nSecond, the best route to achieving that marketshare is exactly what Meta announced: licensing their operating system to device manufacturers who are not only motivated to sell devices, but also provide the necessary R&D and disparate channels to develop headsets for a far wider array of customers and use cases.\nThird, Meta does have the opportunity to actually accomplish what pundits were sure would befall the iPhone: monopolize developer time and attention. A big reason why pundits were wrong about the iPhone, back when they were sure that it was doomed to disruption, was that they misunderstood history. I wrote in 2013’s The Truth About Windows Versus the Mac:\nYou’ve heard the phrase, “No one ever got fired for buying IBM.” That axiom in fact predates Microsoft or Apple, having originated during IBM’s System/360 heyday. But it had a powerful effect on the PC market. In the late 1970s and very early 1980s, a new breed of personal computers were appearing on the scene, including the Commodore, MITS Altair, Apple II, and more. Some employees were bringing them into the workplace, which major corporations found unacceptable, so IT departments asked IBM for something similar. After all, “No one ever got fired…”\nIBM spun up a separate team in Florida to put together something they could sell IT departments. Pressed for time, the Florida team put together a minicomputer using mostly off-the shelf components; IBM’s RISC processors and the OS they had under development were technically superior, but Intel had a CISC processor for sale immediately, and a new company called Microsoft said their OS — DOS — could be ready in six months. For the sake of expediency, IBM decided to go with Intel and Microsoft.\nThe rest, as they say, is history. The demand from corporations for IBM PCs was overwhelming, and DOS — and applications written for it — became entrenched. By the time the Mac appeared in 1984, the die had long since been cast. Ultimately, it would take Microsoft a decade to approach the Mac’s ease-of-use, but Windows’ DOS underpinnings and associated application library meant the Microsoft position was secure regardless.\nEvans is correct: the market today for mobile phones is completely different than the old market for PCs. And, so is Apple’s starting position; iOS was the first modern smartphone platform, and has always had the app advantage. Neither was the case in PCs. The Mac didn’t lose to Windows; it failed to challenge an already-entrenched DOS. The lessons that can be drawn are minimal.\nThe headset market is the opposite of the smartphone market: Meta has been at this for a while, and has a much larger developer base than Apple does, particularly in terms of games. It’s not overwhelming like Microsoft’s DOS advantage already was, to be sure, and I’m certainly not counting out Apple, but this also isn’t the smartphone era when Apple had a multi-year head start.\nTo that end, it’s notable that Meta isn’t just licensing Horizon OS, it is also opening up the allowable app model. From the Oculus Developer blog:\nWe’re also significantly changing the way we manage the Meta Horizon Store. We’re shifting our model from two independent surfaces, Store and App Lab, to a single, unified, open storefront. This shift will happen in stages, first by making many App Lab titles available in a dedicated section of the Store, which will expand the opportunity for those titles to reach their audiences. In the future, new titles submitted will go directly to the Store, and App Lab will no longer be a separate distribution channel. All titles will still need to meet basic technical, content, and privacy requirements to publish to the Store. Titles are reviewed at submission and may be re-reviewed as they scale to more people. Like App Lab today, all titles that meet these requirements will be published.\nApp Lab apps are a middle ground between side-loading (which Horizon OS supports) and normal app store distribution: developers get the benefit of an App Store (easy install, upgrades, etc.) without having to go through full App Review; clear a basic bar and your app will be published. This allows for more experimentation.\nWhat it does not allow for is new business models: App Lab apps, if they monetize, still must use Horizon OS’s in-app payment system. To that end, I think that Meta should consider going even further, and offering up a truly open store: granted, this would reduce the long-run monetization potential of Horizon OS, but it seems to me like that would be an excellent problem to have, given it would mean there was a long-run to monetize in the first place.\nThis remaining limitation does get at the rather fuzzy meaning of “open”: in the case of Horizon OS, Meta means a licensing model for its OS and more freedom for developers relative to Apple; in the case of Llama Meta means open weights and making models into a commodity; in the case of data centers Meta means open specifications, and in the case of projects like React and PyTorch Meta means true open source code.\nMeta, in other words, is not taking some sort of philosophical stand: rather, they are clear-eyed about what their market is (time and attention), and their core differentiation (horizontal services that capture more time and attention than anyone); everything that matters in pursuit of that market and maintenance of that differentiation is worth investing in, and if “openness” means that investment goes further or performs better or handicaps a competitor, then Meta will be open.\nI wrote a follow-up to this Article in this Daily Update.",

    "content": "The world we live in has never been more interconnected, giving people access to more multilingual content than ever before. This also makes the ability to communicate and understand information in any language increasingly important.\nToday, we’re introducing SeamlessM4T, the first all-in-one multimodal and multilingual AI translation model that allows people to communicate effortlessly through speech and text across different languages. SeamlessM4T supports:\nSpeech recognition for nearly 100 languages\nSpeech-to-text translation for nearly 100 input and output languages\nSpeech-to-speech translation, supporting nearly 100 input languages and 36 (including English) output languages\nText-to-text translation for nearly 100 languages\nText-to-speech translation, supporting nearly 100 input languages and 35 (including English) output languages\nIn keeping with our approach to open science, we’re publicly releasing SeamlessM4T under a research license to allow researchers and developers to build on this work. We’re also releasing the metadata of SeamlessAlign, the biggest open multimodal translation dataset to date, totaling 270,000 hours of mined speech and text alignments.\nBuilding a universal language translator, like the fictional Babel Fish in The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, is challenging because existing speech-to-speech and speech-to-text systems only cover a small fraction of the world’s languages. But we believe the work we’re announcing today is a significant step forward in this journey. Compared to approaches using separate models, SeamlessM4T’s single system approach reduces errors and delays, increasing the efficiency and quality of the translation process. This enables people who speak different languages to communicate with each other more effectively.\nSeamlessM4T builds on advancements we and others have made over the years in the quest to create a universal translator. Last year, we released No Language Left Behind (NLLB), a text-to-text machine translation model that supports 200 languages, and has since been integrated into Wikipedia as one of the translation providers. We also shared a demo of our Universal Speech Translator, which was the first direct speech-to-speech translation system for Hokkien, a language without a widely used writing system. And earlier this year, we revealed Massively Multilingual Speech, which provides speech recognition, language identification and speech synthesis technology across more than 1,100 languages.\nSeamlessM4T draws on findings from all of these projects to enable a multilingual and multimodal translation experience stemming from a single model, built across a wide range of spoken data sources with state-of-the-art results.\nThis is only the latest step in our ongoing effort to build AI-powered technology that helps connect people across languages. In the future, we want to explore how this foundational model can enable new communication capabilities — ultimately bringing us closer to a world where everyone can be understood.",

    "content": "Today, we filed a motion for summary judgment, asking the District Court to dismiss the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) effort to unwind the decade-plus acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. From the very beginning, the FTC has failed to state a plausible claim, and the agency has done nothing to build its case through the discovery process to prove otherwise.\nThe evidence shows exactly what we said it would: Meta faces fierce competition from a range of platforms – from TikTok and X to YouTube and Snapchat. Further, Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, which regulators reviewed and cleared more than a decade ago, have benefited consumers. Through billions of dollars and millions of hours of investment, we’ve made the apps better, more reliable, and more secure.\nOur motion, which we outline below, asks the court to award Meta summary judgment and dismiss the FTC’s lawsuit.\nWe Compete Fairly and Face Strong Competition\nThe FTC’s initial complaint was dismissed in its entirety for failure to state a plausible claim. The agency’s amended complaint was allowed to proceed based on its promise to provide evidence that would support  its claims of alleged harm to competition and consumers caused by Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp; the existence of a “personal social networking services” (PSNS) antitrust market; and Meta’s alleged monopoly power in that market.\nAfter more than a year of pre-complaint investigation and two years of extensive litigation discovery, it is more apparent than ever that the FTC cannot prove any of these claims.\nOur acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp are good for consumers and businesses.\nThe FTC has no evidence establishing that Meta’s conduct was “exclusionary” – which is defined as conduct that actually caused harm to competition and consumers.\nAttempting to prove its case, the FTC relies solely on speculative claims that having more competitors may be better and that consumers would have benefitted more if Instagram and WhatsApp had been left without Meta’s resources. The law rightly requires more than speculation.\nEven if the FTC did have a basis for its claims that the deals harmed consumers, the evidence shows the opposite. In reality, our significant investment of time and resources since acquiring the two apps has made them into the services that millions of users enjoy today for free.\nOur acquisition of Instagram has led to a more reliable app for consumers and has helped millions of businesses better engage with and grow  their customer base.\nWhen we acquired Instagram, it had about 2% of the users it has today, just 13 employees, no revenue, and virtually no infrastructure of its own.\nMany of the features that are now central to the Instagram community – direct messaging, live video streaming, shopping, and stories – were built on Meta’s core technology infrastructure after the acquisition.\nOur sophisticated ad creation process, delivery options, and new advertising products provide greater choice for advertisers and consumers.\nWe removed the WhatsApp subscription fee to make it free of charge worldwide, added valuable new features like voice and video calling, and made the app more secure by providing end-to-end encryption.\nAs we anticipated and intended when we made the acquisitions, welcoming Instagram and WhatsApp to the Meta family of apps has provided countless benefits for consumers.\nThe FTC fails to establish a relevant antitrust market.\nThe FTC has failed to meet its burden to present evidence establishing a relevant antitrust market and proving that it has included all reasonable substitute services in its market definition.\nInstead, its alleged “personal social networking services” market is a textbook example of a gerrymandered market, using an artificially limited set of only four companies – Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and MeWe – ignoring many of the most popular activities people engage in on Facebook and Instagram.\nThe FTC relies on unsupported claims that Meta’s apps are “different” – claims that the FTC’s expert witnesses can’t support. In fact, those experts can’t even agree on how Meta’s apps are allegedly different, why those differences matter, or even what “personal social networking services” are or include.\nIn reality, people can and do substitute many services for Facebook and Instagram without friction or cost. A person displeased by the selection of Reels on Facebook or Instagram can move to a similar or even identical short-form video on TikTok or YouTube.\nThe FTC cannot credibly claim Meta has monopoly power because no such power exists.\nThe FTC has no evidence of monopoly power because the alleged monopoly power doesn’t exist.\nThe FTC claims that Meta has a “dominant share” of the artificial “personal social networking services market,” but its market share numbers are meaningless without a properly defined market. And, as the FTC itself acknowledges, Meta’s products are offered for free and in unlimited quantities – and always have been.\nConsumers have benefited as a result of the billions invested to improve the quality of our services: the number of users and amount of usage of all of Meta’s services have increased dramatically since their inception or acquisition, which reflects an improvement in quality of our apps and experiences for consumers.\nNo Sale Is Ever Final\nThe FTC reviewed both acquisitions years ago and allowed them to close. The decision to revisit done deals is tantamount to announcing that no sale will ever be final. This lawsuit not only sows doubt and uncertainty about the US government’s merger review process and whether acquiring businesses can actually rely on the outcomes of the regulatory review process, but it will also make companies think twice about investing in innovation, since they may be punished if that innovation leads to success.\nUS antitrust laws have created the competitive landscape within which American companies must compete to thrive. This competition has driven US companies like Meta to make risky bets, invest, innovate, and deliver value to people, advertisers, and shareholders. Acquisitions of start-ups by large technology companies, like ours of Instagram and WhatsApp, provide essential capital for new ideas and drive the development of new products and technologies. Those deals are risky bets, and many of them aren’t successful in the long run. Companies would be loath to invest in improving purchased assets if there is the possibility that those assets will be unwound (and the progress made undone) through legal challenges years later.\nPut simply, antitrust laws are supposed to promote competition and protect consumers, not punish companies for innovating to give people greater value and choice. We will continue to vigorously defend our company and the ability of people and businesses to choose the great products we offer.",
