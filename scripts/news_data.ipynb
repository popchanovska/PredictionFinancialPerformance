Apple Watch Ultra 2 offers all of the features users love about Ultra, plus the powerful new S9 SiP, a magical new double tap gesture, Apple\\u2019s brightest display ever, expanded altitude range, on-device Siri, Precision Finding for iPhone, and advanced capabilities for water adventures. Apple Watch Ultra 2 runs watchOS 10, which delivers redesigned apps, the new Smart Stack, new cycling experiences, features to help explore the outdoors, and a new watch face \\u2014 Modular Ultra. With all the new advancements, Apple Watch Ultra 2 has the same 36-hour battery life with regular use and up to 72 hours in Low Power Mode.\\n\\nFor the first time, customers can choose a carbon neutral option of any Apple Watch, representing a significant milestone toward Apple 2030: Apple\\u2019s plan to be carbon neutral across its entire business, manufacturing supply chain, and product life cycle by 2030.\\n\\nApple Watch Ultra 2 can be ordered today, with availability beginning Friday, September 22.\\n\\n\\u201cThis year we\\u2019ve made our most rugged and capable Apple Watch even better,\\u201d said Jeff Williams, Apple\\u2019s chief operating officer. \\u201cApple Watch Ultra 2 is our most advanced Apple Watch, with great performance and feature updates. It\\u2019s perfect for anyone who wants our biggest, brightest display, longest battery life, and best GPS of any Apple Watch, all in a stunning design.\\u201d\\n\\nPowerful New S9 SiP\\n\\nApple Watch Ultra 2 is powered by custom Apple silicon in the all-new S9 SiP. Apple\\u2019s most powerful watch chip yet delivers systemwide improvements and brand-new features, including a new double tap gesture and on-device Siri with the ability to access and log health data privately and securely. Apple Watch Ultra 2 also has a new 4-core Neural Engine that can process machine learning tasks up to twice as fast as the original Apple Watch Ultra.\\n\\nDouble Tap Gesture\\n\\nInnovations such as the Digital Crown and Taptic Engine \\u2014 along with gestures like tap, swipe, wrist raise, and cover to mute \\u2014 make Apple Watch simple and intuitive to use. With a new double tap gesture, users can easily control Apple Watch Ultra 2 using just one hand and without touching the display. Users can tap the index finger and thumb of their watch hand together twice to quickly and conveniently perform many of the most common actions on Apple Watch Ultra 2. Double tap will also open the Smart Stack from the watch face, and another double tap will scroll through widgets in the stack.\\n\\nDouble tap controls the primary button in an app so it can be used to stop a timer, play and pause music, or snooze an alarm. The gesture can be used to answer and end a phone call, take a photo with the Camera Remote on Apple Watch, or even switch to the new Elevation view in the Compass app to see the relative elevation of saved waypoints.\\n\\nThe new double tap gesture is enabled by the faster Neural Engine in Apple Watch Ultra 2, which processes data from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and optical heart sensor with a new machine learning algorithm. The algorithm detects the unique signature of tiny wrist movements and changes in blood flow when the index finger and thumb perform a double tap. The double tap gesture will be available in a software update next month.\\n\\nBrighter Display\\n\\nA new advanced display architecture pushes the maximum brightness of Apple Watch Ultra 2 to 3000 nits \\u2014 50 percent brighter than the first generation of Apple Watch Ultra and the brightest display Apple has ever designed \\u2014 for greater readability in harsh sunlight. For dark rooms or early mornings, the display can also lower to just one nit so as not to disturb people close by. Flashlight also benefits from the new display architecture; rotating the Digital Crown temporarily doubles the brightness to better light the way.\\n\\nModular Ultra Watch Face\\n\\nA new watch face designed for Apple Watch Ultra \\u2014 Modular Ultra \\u2014 takes advantage of the large display, using the outermost edge to present real-time data, including seconds, altitude, or depth. It offers the most complications of any Apple digital watch face to customize for sports, outdoor adventures, and ocean and water activities.\\n\\nTested for Extremes\\n\\nApple Watch Ultra 2 is designed for extremes and has been tested for use across the largest range of altitudes for any Apple product, from 500 meters below sea level to explore the lowest valleys, and up to 9,000 meters to ascend the world\\u2019s tallest peaks.\\n\\nRecreational Scuba Diving and Freediving\\n\\nApple Watch Ultra is perfect for water sports, including extreme activities like kitesurfing and wakeboarding, along with recreational scuba diving to 40 meters \\u2014 and now freediving \\u2014 with the updated Oceanic+ app from Huish Outdoors.1\\n\\nThe built-in Depth app now saves a log of each session so users can review the most recent sessions on Apple Watch Ultra or view the complete history of all dives with a GPS entry point in the Fitness app on iPhone.\\n\\nDuring a freedive with the Oceanic+ app, users will see critical data like depth and elapsed time, and receive target depth alerts, all in big, bold, glanceable text. Between dives, heart rate zones help users monitor and lower their heart rate, and preset alarms like surface time and elapsed session time guide users through each training session. The detailed logbook provides a full profile, including descent and ascent speeds.\\n\\nOn-Device Siri with Ability to Access and Log Health Data\\n\\nFor the first time on Apple Watch, Siri requests can be processed on device. For requests that do not require information from the internet, like starting a workout or setting a timer, Siri does not rely on Wi-Fi or cellular networks, resulting in quicker and more reliable responses. The powerful Neural Engine also makes dictation up to 25 percent more accurate.\\n\\nOn-device processing is private and secure, and now Siri can be used to access data from the Health app for health- and fitness-related queries. For example, a user can ask how many hours of sleep they had the previous night, for progress on closing their Activity rings, to start an outdoor run or cycling workout, or make requests like setting a waypoint with just their voice, even with no connectivity. Users can also make Siri requests on Apple Watch Ultra 2 to log health data such as their weight, body temperature, period, or medications taken.2\\n\\nPrecision Finding\\n\\nThe ability to use Apple Watch to find iPhone is a favorite user feature. Now, the S9 SiP includes a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip to enable Precision Finding for the iPhone 15 family, which has the same chip. Precision Finding provides distance and direction, as well as visual, haptic, and audio guidance to a misplaced iPhone, even if it\\u2019s in a different room or a user doesn\\u2019t remember where it\\u2019s been stowed after a dive, for example.\\n\\nFeaturing watchOS 10\\n\\nApple Watch Ultra 2 runs watchOS 10, a milestone update that includes:\\n\\nA fresh approach to quickly view information with redesigned apps and a new Smart Stack to show relevant widgets right when they\\u2019re needed.\\n\\nDelightful new watch faces in addition to the new Modular Ultra face: Snoopy, Palette, Solar Analog, and Nike Globe.\\n\\nNight Mode now uses the ambient light sensor to automatically activate in the dark.\\n\\nBluetooth connectivity for power meters, speed sensors, and cadence sensors arrives for cyclists, unlocking new metrics and Workout Views, and cycling workouts. Power Zones help users get the most out of training.\\n\\nCycling workouts can automatically show up as a Live Activity on iPhone and can utilize the full screen when tapped.\\n\\nThe updated Compass app displays current elevation in real time and includes a 3D view of waypoints showing relative elevation.\\n\\nNew topographic maps in the Maps app show important details like points of interest and trailheads, and provide helpful details such as hill shading, contour lines, elevation, and cellular and Emergency SOS waypoints.\\n\\nAdditional tools to support mental health with state of mind logging in the Mindfulness app.\\n\\nThe ability to measure time spent in daylight using the ambient light sensor to help reduce the risk of myopia.\\n\\nCarbon Neutral Models\\n\\nSelect case and band combinations of Apple Watch Ultra 2, Apple Watch SE, and the new Apple Watch Series 9 are Apple\\u2019s first-ever carbon neutral products. As part of Apple 2030, the carbon footprint of Apple Watch Ultra 2 has been significantly decreased. Emissions were reduced from the three biggest sources of greenhouse gases \\u2014 materials, electricity, and transportation. The small amount of emissions remaining are offset with high-quality carbon credits from nature-based projects. Apple Watch Ultra 2 paired with an Alpine Loop or Trail Loop features 95 percent recycled titanium, compared with no recycled titanium in the first Apple Watch Ultra.3 A new logo on Apple Watch Ultra 2 packaging indicates models that are carbon neutral.\\n\\nLineup\\n\\nApple Watch Ultra 2 is available in 49 mm, and is carbon neutral when paired with a new Trail Loop or Alpine Loop.\\n\\nNew band colors are available for the Alpine Loop (blue, indigo, olive), Trail Loop (orange/beige, green/gray, blue/black), and Ocean Band (blue, orange).\\n\\nAll new Apple Watch Trail Loop and Alpine Loop bands are carbon neutral and contain over 30 percent recycled content.\\n\\nPricing and Availability\\n\\nCustomers in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Japan, the UAE, the U.K., the U.S., and more than 40 other countries and regions can order Apple Watch Ultra 2 today, with availability in stores beginning Friday, September 22.\\n\\nApple Watch Ultra 2 is $799 (U.S.).\\n\\nwatchOS 10 will be available for Apple Watch Series 4 and later on Monday, September 18, and requires iPhone Xs or later running iOS 17. Not all features are available on all devices and in all regions.\\n\\nThree months of Apple Fitness+ are included for customers who purchase Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch SE, Apple Watch Ultra 2, or a new Apple Watch Series 4 or later.\\n\\nFor more information on Apple 2030, visit apple.com/2030.\\n\\nThe Oceanic+ app requires a subscription. These capabilities will be available in a software update later this year, starting in English and Mandarin; they require the download of speech models. This applies to Apple Watch Ultra 2 paired with a Trail Loop or Alpine Loop.\\n\\nAbout Apple Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. Apple\\u2019s five software platforms \\u2014 iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS \\u2014 provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and iCloud. Apple\\u2019s more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it.\\n\\nPress Contacts\\n\\nApple Media Helpline\\n\\nmedia.help@apple.com\",\n          \"At the start of 2020, a team within Google Research was asked to explore new ideas for research projects that focused on accelerating climate mitigation. \\u201cWe were looking into all kinds of big ideas, from cultivated meat to energy to air pollution,\\u201d Dotan Emanuel, a software engineer on the team, says.At the dinner table one evening, Dotan shared some of those big ideas with his family \\u2014 and the conversation soon pivoted to a frustration familiar to many of us: \\u201cMy wife Osnat said, \\u2018Why don\\u2019t you do something about traffic lights? We stand at them for no good reason,\\u2019\\u201d he recalls.Road transportation is responsible for significant global and urban greenhouse gas emissions. It\\u2019s especially problematic at city intersections where pollution can be 29 times higher than on open roads, and about half of these emissions come from traffic accelerating after stopping. With millions of traffic lights across the world, the scale of the problem was huge \\u2014 and if Google could do something to address it, so was the opportunity.\\u201cMy initial thought was that we can\\u2019t do anything about traffic lights,\\u201d Dotan says. \\u201cBut when it comes to research, the most fascinating challenges lie in the unknown.\\u201dWith their curiosity sufficiently piqued, Dotan and his team dug into the mechanics of traffic engineering. They found that while some amount of stop-and-go traffic is unavoidable, a portion can be prevented by optimizing traffic light timing. To do that, cities traditionally needed to either install expensive hardware or run time-consuming manual vehicle counts, neither of which provide complete information on key parameters they need.\\u201cWe quickly understood we have a strong advantage that cities could benefit from \\u2014 over a decade of Google Maps driving trends from across the globe,\\u201d Dotan says. \\u201cAnd a few weeks later, we had a project proposal ready.\\u201dThat proposal was for Project Green Light, an initiative that uses AI to make recommendations for city engineers to optimize existing traffic lights and reduce stop-and-go emissions. After evaluating dozens of other great ideas, Green Light was chosen for its simplicity, scalability and potential for impact.\\nThe Green Light team used Google Maps\\u2019 driving trends to create an AI model that measures how traffic flows through an intersection, including patterns of starting and stopping, average wait times at a traffic light, and coordination between adjacent intersections. The model identifies possible improvements, like shaving off several seconds from a red traffic light during off-peak hours or an opportunity to coordinate between intersections that aren\\u2019t yet synced. The city\\u2019s engineers then review those recommendations and can implement them in as little as five minutes, using their city's existing infrastructure.\\u201cIn order to achieve a positive climate impact, we want to be able to deploy high-quality Green Light recommendations to many cities globally and scale fast. So we purposely set up everything to be simple and lightweight \\u2014 cities don\\u2019t need to invest in any dedicated software or hardware integrations,\\u201d says Green Light Program Manager Alon Harris. \\u201cWe just share our recommendations with the city, and then they evaluate them and take action.\\u201dSince their first pilot in 2021, the team has tested more and more intersections, developed more accurate predictions and took Green Light on the road to more than a dozen cities across the world, including Rio de Janeiro, Seattle, Bengaluru, and most recently, Boston. The team also developed a comprehensive dashboard to easily share recommendations and analytics with partner cities, while continuing to monitor for any new needed changes.\\nThe Green Light dashboard provides city-specific actionable recommendations and supporting trends. After a recommendation has been implemented, the dashboard shows an impact analysis report.\\n\\u201cWe offer each city dedicated reports with tangible impact metrics, such as how many stops drivers saved at an intersection over time. We think that\\u2019s going to be a real incentive to not just implement the first recommendations, but also bring Green Light to more intersections,\\u201d Alon says.Today, Green Light is live in over 70 intersections, helping to save fuel and lower emissions for up to 30 million car rides monthly. Early numbers indicate the potential to reduce stops by up to 30% and reduce emissions at intersections by up to 10%.The team is working to scale Green Light to hundreds of cities and tens of thousands of intersections in the next few years. And on that road to making the world a little better, they hope helping people experience less stop-and-go traffic will spread some joy along the way.\\u201cYou know when you drive through a sequence of five green lights, and it feels like your lucky day?\\u201d Dotan says. \\u201cWe want to make that feeling more common to more people around the world.\\u201d\",\n          \"IBM plans to end 5% matching contributions and 1% automatic contributions to employees\\u2019 401(k) accounts in favor of an automatic 5% retirement benefit provided to all employees, starting January 1, 2024, a company spokesperson confirmed by email.The technology corporation will still allow employees to make deferrals into a 401(k), but it will direct 5% of each employee\\u2019s salary into what it terms a \\u201cRetirement Benefit Account,\\u201d according to a spokesperson and details from a company memo posted to a conversation on the web site Reddit.\\u201cIBM is introducing a new company-provided benefit for U.S. employees called the Retirement Benefit Account within the existing IBM Personal Pension Plan, which helps save for retirement automatically, with no contribution required from the employee,\\u201d explained the spokesperson by email. \\u201cThe RBA adds a stable and predictable benefit that diversifies a retirement portfolio and provides employees greater flexibility and options.\\u201dIBM employer contributions were based on an internal IBM pension formula that varied depending on an employee\\u2019s eligibility for the IBM Personal Pension Plan as of December 31, 2007, and a different set of options for those hired on or after January 1, 2005, according to the firm\\u2019s 2022 Form 5500, filed in July 2023.Currently, IBM automatically enrolls new employees into the DC plan at 5% of eligible salary and performance pay after approximately 30 days of employment with IBM, unless they elect otherwise. New hires become eligible for the IBM automatic contribution and the IBM matching contribution after completing the applicable service requirement, which generally is one year.Additionally, in plan year 2022, \\u201cmatching and automatic contributions were made once annually at the end of the year. In order to receive such IBM employer contributions each year, a participant must be employed on December 15 of the Plan year, and meet all eligibility requirements,\\u201d according to information included in the 2022 Form 5500.Participants in the existing IBM plan are fully vested at all times \\u201cin their account balance, including employee contributions, employer contributions and earnings thereon, if any,\\u201d according to information in the 2022 Form 5500. The IBM memo said the company plans to end matching contributions in a change planned as part of continued improvements to support workers\\u2019 well-being.\\u201cBy introducing this retirement benefit within IBM\\u2019s Personal Pension Plan, which is stable and well-funded, IBM is able to provide a benefit to IBMers that also helps diversify their retirement portfolios,\\u201d the leaked IBM memo stated. \\u201cWe periodically benchmark the benefits IBM offers compared to industry peers, and 5% is aligned to the market\\u2014but in addition, with the RBA, no employee contribution is required.\\u201dAdditional text of the leaked document included a description of the \\u201ckey features of the Retirement Benefit Account\\u201d:Guaranteed 6% annual interest rate for the first 3 years;\\u00a0Tax-deferred growth;\\u00a0Even when the market declines, your balance will not;\\u00a0No enrollment necessary. No investment decisions to make; and\\u00a0Immediately vested and portable.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u2018Concerning\\u2019 for EmployeesIBM planning to end the employer match is uncommon, says Rob Massa, managing director and Houston operations retirement practice leader at Qualified Plan Advisors.\\u201cThe U.S. [private] retirement [system] is a voluntary one and, as long as a plan sponsor follows the law and IRS/[Department of Labor] regulations and administers the plan in accordance with its plan document, they may make any plan design settlor (i.e., non-fiduciary) decisions\\u00a0in any way they prefer,\\u201d he says. \\u201cThe decision to eliminate the match\\u00a0is legally acceptable, and there is no fiduciary liability\\u00a0associated with it.\\u201dPhillip Hulme, chief financial adviser and COO at Atlanta-based Stars & Stripes Financial Advisors, explains that the move by IBM is \\u201cconcerning for employees.\\u201dIBM is shifting risks for retirement benefits from the company and onto employees by taking away workers\\u2019 matching contributions, which means they will be \\u201cearning less,\\u201d Hulme says.The leaked IBM document addressed some of the differences to the existing plan, called the IBM 401(k) Plus Plan. \\u201c[W]e recognize 5% is less than employees are eligible to receive through the current 401(k) Plan,\\u201d the memo stated. \\u201cTo offset the difference, IBM is providing a one-time salary increase effective January 1, 2024, separate from the annual salary plan later in the year.\\u201dIBM reported in a September 2022 SEC filing about its transfer of $16 billion\\u00a0worth of defined benefit pension plan obligations to Prudential Financial and MetLife, one of the biggest pension risk transfer deals ever. The IBM defined benefit plan was frozen to new hires in 2006.In the 2022 plan year, 168,865 IBM retirement plan participants held retirement balances in the IBM 401(K) Plus Plan, comprising more than $53.3 billion in total assets, as of the latest data available.RebrandPlan adviser Massa had not previously heard of a plan sponsor offering something called a \\u201cRetirement Benefit Account.\\u201d\\u201cHowever, under the law, a plan sponsor can name any retirement\\u00a0plan anything they want,\\u201d he says. \\u201cFor example, while most plans use the [IRS\\u2019] IRC [Internal Revenue Code] Section 401(k) in the name of their salary deferral plans, there is no requirement\\u00a0to use that term.\\u201dEmployees will become eligible for the RBA regardless of whether they participate in any other IBM retirement plan, but similar to eligibility for the 401(k) plan, the new benefit has a one-year service requirement, according to the memo.\\u201cBased on what has been shared from IBM, this sounds like a cash balance\\u00a0plan,\\u201d adds Massa. \\u201cIBM currently sponsors a cash balance\\u00a0plan called the \\u2018IBM Personal Pension Plan,\\u2019 and my educated guess is that they are either using this program and rebranding it or constructing a new cash balance plan and calling it the IBM Retirement Benefit Account Plan. Cash balance plans are designed to have both a contribution\\u00a0credit (i.e., 5% per year) and an earnings credit (e.g., 4% per year).\\u00a0So that\\u2019s my best guess as to what they are up to.\\u201d\\u00a0\\u00a0Cash balance plans share some similarities with both DC and DB plans but are regulated as defined benefit plans. \\u00a0IBM\\u2019s plan to eliminate the company match was first reported by The Register, a technology news website based in the U.K. Early reporting was based off of a leaked internal IBM memo and a note on LinkedIn from adviser Hulme, a former IBM employee who says he was aware of the move.\\u201cOn the face of it, I see no [Employee Retirement Income Security Act] issues or legal risks with what they are doing,\\u201d says Massa.\\u00a0\\u201cBut going forward, if this is a cash balance\\u00a0plan, IBM would be assuming the investment risk on the cash balance plan portfolio and will also be assuming the cost of PBGC premiums.\\u201d\\u00a0\\u00a0Despite IBM\\u2019s uncommon move to end retirement plan matching contributions, the company should not face legal issues under ERISA, agrees Drew Oringer, a partner in and general counsel at the Wagner Law Group.\\u201cThe entire private retirement system is voluntary, and IBM has no obligation to continue or provide any particular ongoing benefit,\\u201d says Oringer. \\u201cAn employee benefit, like a 401(k) plan, is in many ways nothing other than another part of the overall compensation package that includes basic salary.\\u201d\"\n        ],\n
